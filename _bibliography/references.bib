	abstract = {No operating molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) exist, so we must rely on computer simulations to study this technology. Popular {MSR} designs to use in simulations include the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}), the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment ({MSRE}), and the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}). A key process to consider for {MSRs} is on-line fuel reprocessing and its effect on reactor dynamics. {SaltProc} is an open source interface code tool that simulates on-line fuel reprocessing when coupled with a depletion-capable transport solver. {SaltProc} was intended to be usable with any depletion solver, but initially was written with support for Serpent2 exclusively. In this work, the {SaltProc} codebase was overhauled to simplify coupling to depletion solvers. Support for {OpenMC} was also added. To ensure that the code maintained existing functionality as well as extended it, the new functionality was validated on a full-core model of the {MSBR}. The results indicate that keff between {OpenMC} and Serpent2 differ by +35 pcm at beginning of life and by 700 pcm at the end of the simulation after one year of operation. Additionally, the relative difference of most actinides is less than 2\%. The actinides with smaller concentrations in the fuel tend to have larger relative differences between the two codes. The results for fission products are similar, however, the relative differences are smaller, with most of the fission products having a relative difference no greater than 0.6\%. There are some outliers in the results with very high relative errors, however, these can be attributed to numerical errors. This is significant as this makes {SaltProc} the first completely open-source tool to flexibly and accurately simulate on-line fuel reprocessing.},

	abstract = {Current radioisotope identification devices struggle to identify and quantify isotopes in low-resolution gamma-ray spectra in a wide range of realistic conditions. Trained gamma-ray spectroscopists typically rely on intuition when identifying isotopes in spectra. A trained gamma-ray spectroscopist can inject their intuition into pattern recognition algorithms by creating training datasets and intelligently choosing a machine learning model for a task. Algorithms based on feature extraction such as peak finding or {ROI} algorithms work well for well-calibrated high resolution detectors. For low-resolution detectors, it may be more beneficial to use algorithms that incorporate more abstract features of the spectrum. To investigate this, we simulated datasets and used them to train artificial neural networks ({ANNs}) for identification and quantification tasks using gamma-ray spectra. Because the datasets were simulated, this method can be extended to a variety of gamma-ray spectroscopy tasks. Models weinvestigated include dense, convolutional, and autoencoder {ANNs}. In this work we introduce annsa, an open source Python package capable of creating gamma-ray spectroscopy training datasets and applying machine learning models to solve spectroscopic tasks. Using annsa, we found that identification performance in simulated spectra was sensitive to the source-to-background ratio, detector gain setting, and shielding. Performance was less sensitive to the source-detector height and detector resolution. We demonstrate annsa’s capabilities on a source inter-
diction classification problem, outperforming a peak-based Bayesian classifier for source identification. We also demonstrate annsa on a uranium enrich-
ment quantification problem which shows an accuracy useful for homeland security applications.},

	shorttitle = {Contract {DE}-{NE}0008567},
	abstract = {In many fuel cycle simulators, the user must define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid supply chain gaps. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle ({NFC}) simulators should bring demand-responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. Thus, a next-generation {NFC} simulator should predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. {CYCLUS} is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework [4]. In {CYCLUS}, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is an agent. Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution and facility agents can be grouped into. Institution agents control the deployment and decommission of facility agents and represents legal operating organizations such as a utility, government, etc. Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. {CYCAMORE} provides agents to represent process physics of various components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor). The Demand-Driven {CYCAMORE} Archetypes project ({NEUP}-{FY}16-10512) aims to develop {CYCLUS}’ demand-driven deployment capabilities. This capability is added as a {CYCLUS} Institution agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. This demand-driven deployment capability is called d3ploy. In this paper, we explain the capabilities of d3ploy and demonstrate how d3ploy minimizes undersupply of all commodities in a few simulations while meeting key simulation constraints. Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand transition scenarios are demonstrated. Insights are discussed to inform parameter input decisions for future work in setting up larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. And finally, the more complex transition scenarios are demonstrated.},

	title = {Modeling Special Nuclear Material Diversion from a Pyroprocessing Facility},
	rights = {Copyright 2019 Greg Westphal},
	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the {US}, used nuclear fuel ({UNF})
steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in
which reprocessing reduces build up of {UNF}. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this
transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor ({LWR}) and metallic fuels,
and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar to safety-by-design in next-generation
reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguardsby-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived
through modeling and simulation.
This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety
of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class
capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material
production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and
current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency ({IAEA}) inspections
and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.
These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current {US} fuel cycle to a
sodium fast reactor ({SFR}) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined
through sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between
the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for ({MUF}). This work also
expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel
cycle fidelity.},

The baseline design for this Mark-I {PB}-{FHR} (Mk1) plant is a 236-{MW}(thermal) reactor. The Mk1 uses a fluoride salt coolant with solid, coated-particle pebble fuel. The Mk1 design differs from earlier {FHR} designs because it uses a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle designed to produce 100 {MW}(electric) of base-load electricity using a modified General Electric 7FB gas turbine. For peak electricity generation, the Mk1 has the ability to boost power output up to 242 {MW}(electric) using natural gas co-firing. The Mk1 uses direct heating of the power conversion fluid (air) with the primary coolant salt rather than using an intermediate coolant loop. By combining results from computational neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and pebble dynamics, {UCB} has developed a detailed design of the annular core and other key functional features. Both an active normal shutdown cooling system and a passive, natural-circulation-driven emergency decay heat removal system are included. Computational models of the {FHR}-validated using experimental data from the literature and from scaled thermal-hydraulic facilities-have led to a set of design criteria and system requirements for the Mk1 to operate safely and reliably. Three-dimensional, computer-aided-design models derived from the Mk1 design criteria are presented.},

The {GENIUSv}2 tool proposes to inform nuclear fuel cycle technology and policy by providing a richly detailed, modular platform capable of dynamically modeling complexly integrated international fuel cycles such as those involving separations and reprocessing schemes.
Here we present results of the {GENIUSv}2 testing suite which demonstrate neutronics weighting methods for approximating optimal mixed oxide fuel compositions. These weighting methods achieve various levels of success at assembling critical fuel recipes from separated spent fuel streams for fuel cycles incorporating mixed oxide reprocessing. Results of neutronics constraining and neutronics weighting methods are here compared and alternative linear programmatic formulations are proposed for determining mixed-oxide ({MOX}) fuel compositions from available material.},

Here, we report a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical study of a liquid-solid-like phase transition which takes place in a vertically vibrated fluidized granular monolayer. The first experimental setup is a long, narrow channel, with a width of the order of a few particle diameters, hence the dynamics is quasi-one-dimensional. We have considered this configuration to characterize the dynamic behavior of the phase transition. The second setup is used to measure the pressure as function of particle density in order to clarify the physical mechanism behind this phase transition. We demonstrate that the transition is mediated by waves and that it is triggered by a negative compressibility as in van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. Finally, in order to further characterize this phase transition, we study static and dynamic correlation functions, and bond-orientational order parameters.},

It can be a component of the academic research methods used to produce research results, or it may itself be an academic research result. Software, however, has rarely been considered to be a citable artifact in its own right. With the advent of open-source software, artifact evaluation committees of conferences, and journals that include source code and running systems as part of the published artifacts, we foresee that software will increasingly be recognized as part of the academic process. The quality and sustainability of this software must be accounted for, both a priori and a posteriori.

The Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop on “Engineering Academic Software” has examined the strengths, weaknesses, risks, and opportunities of academic software engineering. A key outcome of the workshop is this Dagstuhl Manifesto, serving as a roadmap towards future professional software engineering for software-based research instruments and other software produced and used in an academic context. The manifesto is expressed in terms of a series of actionable “pledges” that users and developers of academic research software can take as concrete steps towards improving the environment in which that software is produced.},

It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, {JOSS} addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. {JOSS} publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A {JOSS} article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a {JOSS} submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on {GitHub}. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, {JOSS} does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, {JOSS} gives it a digital object identifier ({DOI}), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their {JOSS} article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, {JOSS} published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. {JOSS} is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization {NumFOCUS} and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative ({OSI}).},

Current work introduces an extension of the {MOOSE} framework, Moltres, to appropriately model coupled thermal-hydraulics and neutronics of promising molten-salt-fueled reactor designs. Additionally, we have developed an online reprocessing simulation tool, {SaltProc} which includes fission product removal, fissile material separations, and refuelling for time dependent analysis of fuel-salt evolution. Initial simulations of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and the conceptual Molten Salt Breeder Reactor have been conducted on Blue Waters with deterministic multiphysics and Monte Carlo methods respectively. Steady state, transient, and fuel cycle analysis simulations have been run in 2D as well as 3D and compared against the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Fuel cycle dynamics and quasi-equilibrium compositions were obtained from depletion and reprocessing simulations for a 20-year time frame. The {MSBR} full-core safety analysis was performed at the startup and equilibrium fuel salt compositions, for important reactor safety parameters. In this work, conducted on Blue Waters, {ARFC} has demonstrated the capability to model complex physics in an advanced molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactor.},

Verification studies compare various fuel cycle analysis tools to test agreement and identify sources of difference. A recent verification study, Feng et al. (2016) established transition scenario test case specifications and accordingly evaluated national laboratory nuclear fuel cycle simulators, {DYMOND}, {VISION}, {ORION}, and {MARKAL}. This work verifies the performance of Cyclus, the agent-based, open-source fuel cycle simulator, using the test case specifications in Feng et. al. In this work, Cyclus demonstrates agreement with the results from the previous verification study. Minor differences reflect intentional, detailed material tracking in the Cycamore reactor module. These results extend the example results in Feng et al. to further enable future verification of additional nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools.},

A Cyclus simulation captured nuclear power deployment in the {EU} from 1970 to 2160. In this simulation, France begins its planned transition to {SFRs} as existing {LWRs} are decommissioned. These {SFRs} are fueled with {UNF} accumulated by other {EU} nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and {SFR} breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional {LWRs} by accepting {UNF} from other {EU} nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, {SaltProc}, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, {SERPENT}2 to simulate {MSR} online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of {MSR} fuel salt. This work demonstrates {SaltProc} capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

	title = {Investigation of Agricultural Uses of Nuclear Waste Heat. {UIUC} Technical Report. October, 2018.},
	abstract = {Nuclear power plants ({NPPs}) produce significant quantities of waste heat due to the low thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. This waste heat carries roughly two-thirds of the total power generated at a nuclear power plant. It is responsibly released to the environment as a warm water flow, carrying with it a massive amount of low-grade thermal energy. As of now, this energy is lost from all Exelon {NPPs}. This waste heat is essentially a free source of energy and utilization projects offer the potential to significantly increase the thermal efficiency and profitability of centralized power generating stations, in particular {NPPs}.
Agricultural projects, particularly climate-controlled greenhouses, may show the most dramatic benefit from waste-heat utilization. Due to the relatively low temperature requirements of greenhouses, heating costs may be eliminated or cut substantially by the implementation of waste heat. The technical readiness of coupling central power generation station’s waste heat discharge to climate-controlled greenhouses is high and has been demonstrated. Implementing this combined heat and power approach to Exelon’s fleet of {NPPs} could offer significant advantages over fossil fueled power plants due to their high capacity factor, and strictly controlled and monitored water discharge.   
Exelon {NPPs} at Braidwood, Byron, Dresden, and Calvert Cliffs hold potential to supply significant agricultural waste heat. Few regulations exist specific to the use of waste heat from {NPPs}, but the discharge of waste heat from {NPPs} is strictly regulated, mitigating potential for regulatory hurdles to its use in other industries. Waste heat from Exelon’s {NPPs} is an untapped and potentially lucrative commodity. In the Midwest, the location of Exelon’s {NPPs} offers interesting opportunities for waste heat use in agriculture. The cold Midwest climate is normally a limiting factor in crop diversity and heated greenhouses are an option for overcoming this issue, but the heating costs are a barrier themselves. With cooperation between growers and the Exelon Corporation, waste heat may be commoditized while also facilitating more efficient and diverse growing operations. Waste heat use is not limited to farming operations. There are a host of industries that can benefit from waste heat use that may be local to other power plants. The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located ideally to facilitate the farming of oysters with waste heat or even provide heat for liquefied natural gas vaporization. 
This report details a preliminary analysis to evaluate the potential for utilizing waste heat from {NPPs}. From the exhaustive review of past waste heat efforts, agricultural options, and primary economic and radiological factors, the technical readiness is shown to be high and the concept is sound. It is recommended that a detailed analysis should follow that includes: coupling candidate {NPPs} to specific greenhouse architectures, exploration of high-value crop options in prototypic and bounding event environments, and a detailed economic assessment.},

This same goal could also be achieved by setting all the facility’s ca- pacities to infinity. However, this does not reflect real-world conditions [1]. To address this gap in capability of fuel cycle simulators, the Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project ({NEUP}-{FY}16-10512) is developing prediction algorithms to give Cyclus demand-driven deployment capabilities. This means that Cyclus will have the capability to deploy sup- porting fuel cycle facilities to meet front-end and back-end demands of the fuel cycle. The project is a collaboration between the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of South Carolina. This paper will discuss the numerical experiments required to test the various prediction algorithms designed for the project. In particular, this work describes tests for the non-optimizing algorithm.},

This thesis introduces a Python script, {SaltProc}, which simulates {MSR} online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. {SaltProc} couples with the Monte Carlo code, {SERPENT} 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. {SaltProc} capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled {MSBR} fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on {MSBR} operations; and (3) estimating {MSBR} fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the {MSBR} demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/{GWh}(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during {MSBR} operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in advanced reactors and the following need for techno-economic transitions has increased the demand for tools necessary to model complex nuclear fuel cycles ({NFCs}) and advanced reactor technologies. This thesis demonstrates the capability of {CYCLUS} , the agent-based fuel cycle simulator, to model, simulate, and analyze real-life fuel cycle transition scenarios. I introduce new methods and tools that use various databases to model and simulate real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios involving advanced reactor technologies.

The work in this thesis contains: (1) benchmarking Cyclus to other nuclear fuel cycle simulators ({NFC} simulators); (2) developing new methods and tools necessary for modeling and simulating real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios; (3) simulation of both domestic and international nuclear technology transitions.

The methods and tools developed for such capabilities include: (1) modeling and simulating past and current nuclear fleets using historic nuclear reactor operations database; (2) modeling individual reactors and their operating history to calculate nuclear material inventory; (3) modeling Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) behavior in a large-scale fuel cycle simulation.

Benchmark work shows that {CYCLUS} results coincide with results from other {NFC} simulators with minor differences due to modeling choices. Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the {CYCLUS} capability to effectively model and simulate real-life {NFC} transition scenarios that involve advanced reactor technologies such as {MSRs}.},

In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy.

These systems are often referred to as nuclear hy- brid energy systems ({NHES}) and are generally robust, reliable, economically appealing, and have low to zero greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions [1, 2, 3, 4]. In 2015, the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign ({UIUC}) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Ac- tion Plan ({iCAP}) [5]. This plan identified nuclear energy as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we use the {RAVEN} framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity ({LCOE}) for the {UIUC} embedded grid. The greatest source economic variability is contained in the capital costs of a micro-reactor. Thus we examine both scenarios where the reactor is provided at no cost to the university and purchased at full price.},

Costs drive the equation, but policies affecting electricity pricing also influence nuclear power revenues at a fundamental level. In current reactors and their associated fuel cycles, capital, operation, and maintenance costs increasingly dominate the economics of nuclear power.
Advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle choices can impact these costs both positively
and negatively. While fuel cycle advancements also impact fuel costs, this component has a relatively small impact on the overall cost of nuclear electricity production, particularly in comparison to capital costs. If advanced reactors can offer very high-temperature heat appropriate for industrial processing, natively couple with storage technologies, or can otherwise acheive load following behavior, then they may become more financially feasible than the current fleet.},

Given the abundance of {WH} from {NPPs} and the ubiquity of generally low-grade heat requirements of agricultural operations, from production to post-harvest, there is remarkable potential to harness {NPP} {WH} for agricultural uses with mutual economic advantages to {NPPs} and agricultural sectors. Taking advantage of this {WH} resource may improve the financial outlook of both the partnered power plants and agricultural businesses by providing an additional revenue stream, decreased heating costs, and a reduced carbon footprint. This review summarizes and interprets the historical discourse and research on agricultural applications of {NPP} {WH} in the U.S., and synthesizes technical constraints, unknowns, and opportunities for realizing the benefits of {WH} derived from the nuclear energy sector for agricultural value chains. Previous applications of {WH} in the agricultural industry demonstrate that this is a viable option to the benefit of the parties involved under the right conditions, but relatively little has been done to further this technology in the U.S. in recent years or explore novel applications. A revival of interest in this technology may be warranted given the current outlook for {NPPs} in the U.S. and a general interest in reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.},

Prior development work has utilized tech- niques such as system dynamics to provide a solution structure for the matching of supply and demand in these simulations. In general, however, simulation infrastructure development has occured in relatively closed circles, each effort having unique considerations as to the cases which are desired to be modeled. Accordingly, individual simulators tend to have their design decisions driven by specific use cases. Presented in this work is a proposed supply and demand matching algorithm that lever- ages the techniques of the well-studied field of mathematical programming. A generic approach is achieved by treating fa- cilities as individual entities and actors in the supply-demand market which denote preferences amongst commodities. Using such a framework allows for varying levels of interaction fi- delity, ranging from low-fidelity, quick solutions to high-fidelity solutions that model individual transactions (e.g. at the fuel- assembly level). The power of the technique is that it allows such flexibility while still treating the problem in a generic man- ner, encapsulating simulation engine design decisions in such a way that future simulation requirements can be relatively easily added when needed.},

The {MSR} has been designed to operate with a Th/233U fuel cycle with 233U used as startup fissile material. Since 233U does not exist in nature, we must examine other available fissile materials to start up these reactor concepts. This work investigates the fuel cycle and neutronics performance of the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor ({SD}-{TMSR}) with different fissile material loadings at startup: High Assay Low Enriched Uranium ({HALEU}) (19.79\%), Pu mixed with {HALEU} (19.79\%), reactor-grade Pu (a mixture of Pu isotopes chemically extracted from Pressurized Water Reactor ({PWR}) spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) with 33 {GWd}/{tHM} burnup), transuranic elements ({TRU}) from Light Water Reactor ({LWR}) {SNF}, and 233U. The {MSR} burnup routine provided by {SERPENT}-2 is used to simulate the online reprocessing and refueling in the {SD}-{TMSR}. The effective multiplication factor, fuel salt composition evolution, and net production of 233U are studied in the present work. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation is calculated. The results show that the continuous flow of reactor-grade Pu helps transition to the thorium fuel cycle within a relatively short time (≈4.5 years) compared to 26 years for 233U startup fuel. Finally, using {TRU} as the initial fuel materials offers the possibility of operating the {SD}-{TMSR} for an extended period of time (≈40 years) without any external feed of 233U.},

In 2015, the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign ({UIUC}) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Ac- tion Plan ({iCAP}) [5]. This plan identified nuclear energy as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we use the {RAVEN} framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity ({LCOE}) for the {UIUC} embedded grid. The greatest source economic variability is contained in the capital costs of a micro-reactor. Thus we examine both scenarios where the reactor is provided at no cost to the university and purchased at full price.},

The {MSFR} can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the {MSFR} using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment ({MOOSE}) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink ({ULOHS}) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with {SERPENT} and published {MSFR} results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the {ULOHS} scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing {MSFR} simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an {MSFR} loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

institutional framework, and trading in flexible markets. Key
concepts in the design of C {YCLUS} include open access to the
simulation engine, modularity with regard to functionality, and
relevance to both scientific and policy analyses. The combina-
tion of modular encapsulation within the software architec-
ture and an open development paradigm allows for a bal-
ance between collaboration at multiple levels of simulation
detail and security of proprietary or sensitive data.
When comparing different nuclear fuel cycle concepts, it
can be a challenge to find any two systems analyses that com-
pare across a common set of metrics with a similar set of un-
derlying assumptions. Each analysis is likely to focus on a set
of metrics that are of interest to the team performing the analy-
sis and involve both implicit and explicit assumptions and con-
straints about the behavior of the fuel cycle system. While
a strict prescription of these metrics, assumptions and con-
straints could be proposed for comparison purposes, another
solution is to provide a systems analysis simulation tool that
provides sufficient modularity, extensibility and open access,
that it can be a basis for harmonzing to a common set. If it
becomes easier to modify an existing simulation tool to sup-
port the needs of a new analysis than it is to develop a new

	abstract = {The theory of non-ideal gases at thermodynamic equilibrium, for instance the van der Waals gas model, has played a central role in our
understanding of coexisting phases, as well as the transitions between them. In contrast, the theory fails with granular matter because
collisions between the grains dissipate energy, and their macroscopic size renders thermal fluctuations negligible. When a mass of
grains is subjected to mechanical vibration, it can make a transition to a fluid state. In this state, granular matter exhibits patterns and
instabilities that resemble those of molecular fluids. Here, we report a granular solid–liquid phase transition in a vibrating granular
monolayer. Unexpectedly, the transition is mediated by waves and is triggered by a negative compressibility, as for van der Waals
phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. The dynamic behaviour
that we observe—coalescence, coagulation and wave propagation—is common to a wide class of phase transitions. We have combined
experimental, numerical and theoretical studies to build a theoretical framework for this transition.},

The analysis focuses on the four key sectors of storage, supplementing the gas grid, power generation, and transportation, detailing the potential range of hydrogen technologies which are expected to penetrate Japanese energy markets up to 2050 and beyond. Alongside key model outcomes, the appropriate policy settings, governance and market mechanisms are described which underpin the potential hydrogen economy future for Japan. We find that transportation, gas grid supplementation, and storage end-uses may emerge in significant quantities due to policies which encourage ambitious implementation targets, investment in technologies and research and development, and the emergence of a future carbon pricing regime. On the other hand, for Japan which will initially be dependent on imported hydrogen, the cost of imports appears critical to the emergence of broad hydrogen usage, particularly in the power generation sector. Further, the consideration of demographics in Japan, recognizing the aging, shrinking population and peoples\&rsquo; energy use preferences will likely be instrumental in realizing a smooth transition toward a hydrogen economy.},

This work adopted the {SERPENT}-2 Monte Carlo code to analyze the whole core model of the {SD}-{TMSR}. Built-in {SERPENT}-2 capabilities simulated online reprocessing and refueling and calculated the multiplication factor and Breeding Ratio ({BR}). We found that the molten salt Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity (αT) was negative for initial and equilibrium states. This study investigated the variation of the multiplication factor, {BR}, and build-up of important nuclides in the core as a function of burnup. Under online reprocessing and refueling, we studied the variation of the reactivity during 60 years of reactor operation. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation was calculated. Finally, these simulations determined the appropriate 232Th and 233U feed rates for maintaining criticality and enabled analysis of the overall {SD}-{TMSR} fuel cycle performance.},

The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

	abstract = {Localizing a radiation source in an urban environment is a challenge in nuclear nonproliferation
and radiation detection. One approach to localize a source is to send a mobile radiation sensor
network into an area of interest to collect count rate measurements at many locations in an
attempt to find the radiation source. However, there are numerous temporal and spatial factors
that cause changes in background count rate measurements, and these factors make it challenging
to analyze the collected data. Displaying these measurements in a virtual environment has
contextualized them and helps a user determine if environmental factors are introducing false
positives. A virtual model has been shown to visualize collected measurements in near real-time,
but not in real-time. The ability for a user to quickly address alarm measurements is hampered
by this lack of real-time data access as well as due to poor quality virtual models.
Another challenge in radiation detection is sampling an environment to assess the status of an
area following a radiological or nuclear incident. Following an incident, environmental samples
must be collected and analyzed to identify the radioactive substances present and assess the
environmental damages. Incident response must be rapid and the sample collection must occur
without error. A software named Visual Sample Plan ({VSP}) has been developed by Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory ({PNNL}) to help guide the sample collection process and
statistically inform decisions. This thesis begins with an overview of the radiation source search
and environmental sampling problems and how they have been addressed. Next, earlier work that
has attempted to address each of these problems and the motivation for these responses is
discussed. Finally, new work extending the prior solutions is discussed. To address the radiation
source search problem, a method to create higher quality 3D models is explored, and an alternate
method to store and retrieve data in the cloud using {DynamoDB} is implemented. By
implementing {VSP} in Augmented Reality ({AR}), opportunities for error are further limited. This
thesis concludes with suggestions for future work to approach robust solutions to each problem.},

	abstract = {In the search for new ways to generate carbon-free, reliable base-load power, interest in advanced nuclear energy technologies, particularly Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}), has resurged with multiple new companies pursuing {MSR} commercialization. To further develop these {MSR} concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled {MSR} depletion and fuel processing. Current {MSR} modeling efforts in the literature usually assume ideal (e.g., 100\% of neutron poison being removed) rather than realistically constrained removal efficiency. This work proposes to create a Python package, {SaltProc}, which will implement realistically constrained extraction efficiency of fission product based on physical models of fuel processing components appearing in various {MSR} systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of {SaltProc}, the Transatomic Power ({TAP}) concept will be simulated to capture the evolution of fuel salt composition during reactor operation with a realistic, physics-driven model of an online fuel reprocessing system. {SaltProc} will also be applied to determine the feasibility and safety of load following for the {TAP} system. This proposal outlines extensions to this work, including investigating safety parameters (temperature coefficients, shutdown margin, axial power offset) evolution over a 60-year reactor operation lifetime and during short-term load-following transients.},

Accurately predicting the generation from solar and wind may help minimize profit losses for nuclear power plants. Nu- clear power competes with natural gas to fulfill the net demand after accounting for renewable energy sources. Load following gives natural gas an economic edge over nuclear power be- cause natural gas plants can follow grid demand and even shut off when renewable penetration makes the price of electricity go negative [2]. It is possible for existing nuclear plants to load follow somewhat and some French nuclear plants have been retrofitted to follow daily variations in electricity demand [3]. As penetration of solar and wind energy increases around the world, load following will depend less on electric demand pro- files and more on renewable energy profiles. This shift makes load following with current nuclear power plants intractable [4]. Renewable energy challenges the base load electricity production that nuclear provides in the United States by in- troducing grid demand variability. Advanced reactor designs, like some Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}), promise strong load following capabilities due to active 135Xe removal [5]. Unfor- tunately, the most mature {MSR} designs are at least a decade away from obtaining a commercial license in the United States. The climate crisis is too urgent to wait this long for nuclear power to become fully competitive with natural gas [6].
Variability has been the primary drawback for renewable energy sources like wind turbines, solar {PV}, and solar concen- trators, since their inception. This flaw worsens as renewable energy penetration increases [4]. Forecasting electricity pro- duction from renewable sources is therefore important for successful management of power systems [7]. Recent studies applied artificial neural networks ({ANNs}), specifically multi- layer perceptrons, to the task of net load forecasting [7, 8, 9]. These studies made short term forecasts of 4-6 hours but nu- clear plants need accurate forecasts further ahead to facilitate load following. This study will be the first to apply Echo State Networks ({ESNs}) to the task of net load prediction.},

	url = {https://books.google.com/books/about/GLOBAL_2017.html?id=1UjsuQEACAAJ},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, {NFC} simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a {NFC} simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current {NFC} simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},

	doi = {10.21105/joss.00298},
	shorttitle = {Moltres},
	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
({MSRs}) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using {MPI} which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and {MOOSE} allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
{MOOSE} provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(Kópházi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System ({UNF}-{ST}\&{DARDS}) Unified Database ({UDB}) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. {UNF} inventory profile predicted by the model with the {UDB} {UNF} inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for {UNF} inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope {GENeration} ({ORIGEN}) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle ({NFC}) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity {PWR} depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to {NFC} simulators.

- Nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste disposal decisions are technologically coupled through the characteristics of spent fuel which vary among fuel cycles and impact repository design and performance
- Dynamic integration of generic disposal model with fuel cycle systems analysis framework is necessary to illuminate performance distinctions of candidate repository host media, designs, and engineering components in the context of fuel cycle options
- Most current tools treat waste disposal phase of fuel cycle analysis statically in post processing by reporting values such as mass, volumes, radiotoxicity, or heat production of accumulated {SNF} and high level waste. They fail to address the dynamic impact of the waste streams on the performance of the geologic disposal system.

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign ({UIUC}) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in {MSRs} produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, {MSRs} transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power ({TAP}) {MSR}. A Python toolkit, {SaltProc} v0.1 [1–3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}). More recently, an advanced {SaltProc} version ({SaltProc} v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the {TAP} system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate {SaltProc} and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

nuclear power. In the context of high-performance computing, this
work requires the coupling of multiple physics models at multiple
scales to model and simulate the design, safety, and performance
of advanced nuclear reactors. In particular, thermal–hydraulic
phenomena, neutron transport, and fuel performance couple
tightly in nuclear reactors. Detailed spatially and temporally
resolved neutron flux and temperature distributions can improve
designs, help characterize performance, inform reactor safety
margins, and enable validation of numerical modeling techniques
for those unique physics. In the work presented here, conducted
on Blue Waters, {ARFC} has demonstrated the capability to simulate
coupled, transient neutronics and thermal hydraulics in an
advanced, molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactor.},

The primary purpose of {JOSS} is to enable developers of research software to receive citation credit equivalent to typical archival publications. {JOSS} papers are deliberately extremely short, and are required to include a short abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, authors and their affiliations, and key references, as well as link to an archived version of the software (e.g., {DOI} obtained from Zenodo). Upon acceptance, papers receive a {CrossRef} {DOI}. Rather than a review of a lengthy software paper (including, e.g., methodology, validation, sample results), {JOSS} submissions undergo rigorous peer review of both the abstract and software itself, including documentation, tests, continuous integration, and licensing. The {JOSS} review process is modeled on the established approach of the {rOpenSci} collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on {GitHub}; papers not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance---unlike other journals, papers requiring major revision are not rejected. Since its public release in May 2016, {JOSS} has published 26 accepted papers as of September 2016, with an additional 20 submitted and under review.},

The current work introduces a reliable safety system based on control rods in addition to the online feed system reactivity control in the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor ({SD}-{TMSR}). Three different initial fissile loadings are considered: 233U, reactor-grade Pu, and transuranic ({TRU}) elements as a startup fuel. We applied six different absorbing materials to investigate the main operational and safety parameters in the {SD}-{TMSR}: natural B4C, enriched B4C with 90\% 10B, {HfB}2, {HfH}1.62, Eu2O3, and Gd2O3. The present work focuses on control rod design, integral and differential control rod worth, shutdown margin, and shadowing effects at steady-state. We employed the {SERPENT}-2 Monte-Carlo code to calculate the reactivity worth and analyze the performance of the reactivity control system. We showed that 233U and reactor-grade Pu startup cores maintain adequate shutdown margin with all considered absorbers. Finally, this paper proposes a design of control rod clusters that compensate the excess reactivity of the {SD}-{TMSR} loaded with different initial fissile material.},

	rights = {Copyright 2021 Anshuman Chaube},
	abstract = {In an effort to curb carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change, energy policymakers are considering advanced nuclear reactors as a potential source of clean base-load energy. Once such family of reactor designs is called the Molten Salt Reactor, which has been successfully demonstrated experimentally during the operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment({MSRE}) at the Oak-Ridge National Laboratory during the 1960s. Thermal-hydraulic simulations of this reactor are an important step towards validating and verifying simulation tools for other molten salt reactor designs and exploring the potential of such reactors for licensing. Modern {CFD} simulations of the {MSRE} reactor core often discount the effects of turbulence in this reactor due to the low Reynolds number inside the {MSRE} channels. They also neglect the pyramidal tip at the top of the moderator graphite blocks called stringers. However, recent research indicates turbulence can play a significant role in compact reactor cores at relatively low Reynolds numbers. Our main concern is entrainment of fuel salt in recirculation zones and subsequent creation of localised hotspots. Therefore, we investigated the presence of such recirculation zones and the effect of the tip-shape on turbulence and stationary vortices in the upper plenum.
We analysed the flow around an {MSRE} graphite stringer using large eddy simulations performed in Nek5000. We also studied the effects of varying the size and shape of the stringer-tip using Nek5000’s mesh deformation capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first effort to apply large eddy simulations to the {MSRE} and study the effects of geometry-induced turbulence and recirculation within the {MSRE}. We analysed the output data and found that salt recirculation vortices do exist and geometry and turbulence affect the salt flow in the upper plenum. But fuel salt recirculation does not impact the temperature of the salt or graphite significantly. We also determined the ideal tip-shape that minimises salt recirculation and entrapment. We found that a pyramidal tip with an apex half-angle of 45◦ disrupts recirculation, encourages mixing, and improves heat transfer, keeping salt and graphite temperatures low, whereas angles that are as small as 30◦ or large enough to tend towards a flat-top lead to hotter temperatures. Implications for the design and simulation of similar channel-type molten salt reactors are discussed.},

A Python toolkit, {SaltProc} v0.1 [1–3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}). More recently, an advanced {SaltProc} version ({SaltProc} v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the {TAP} system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design.

Previous energy systems research has shown that such clean energy goals cannot be reached if nuclear plants prematurely retire [2, 3, 4]. In particular, the February 2021 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus report, “Accelerating Decarbonization of the U.S. Energy System,” determined unequivocally that {US} decarbonization will require keeping existing nuclear plants open [2].

To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle ({NFC}) simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy. User-controlled capabilities such as supply/ capacity buffers, constraint deployment, prediction algorithms, and installed capacity deployment were introduced in d3ploy to give a user the tools to minimize commodity undersupply in a simulation. We demonstrate d3ploy’s capability to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet various types of user-defined power demands: constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal.},

	abstract = {Under the auspices on {OECD}-{NEA}, a benchmark has been initiated to assess state of the art modelling and simulation capabilities for Fluoride salt-cooled High-temperature Reactors ({FHRs}) with {TRISO} fuel embedded in fuel plates (“planks”) of hexagonal fuel elements. Benchmark phases I-A and I-B involve reactor physics analysis of a representative fuel element, without and with depletion. Several configurations are considered (e.g., unrodded and rodded configuration, presence of burnable absorbers, variable enrichment). Parameters compared include multiplication factor, reactivity coefficients, flux distribution, neutron spectrum and isotopic composition change with burnup. Seven organizations from four countries are taking part in this blind-benchmark exercise, using Monte Carlo and deterministic methods. Given the complex combination of materials and geometry, the {FHR} benchmark is expected to be challenging, particularly for deterministic codes. As the nuclear data libraries underpinning both deterministic and Monte Carlo methods have had limited testing for {FHR} systems, and molten salt systems in general, the benchmark aims to provide feedback to both the nuclear data community as well as molten salt reactor designers with regards to the variance of results with different nuclear data sources. This paper reports on the current results submitted and provides comparisons and analysis. Overall, the observed agreement is satisfactory, although notable differences are identified in specific cases, suggesting need for further in-depth analysis of those cases.},

Fuel cycle scenarios considered include the current fleet of Light Water Reactors in the U.S. as well as a no-growth and a 1\% growth transition to either the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor or the X-energy Xe-100 reactor from the current fleet of U.S. Light Water Reactors. This work explored parameters of interest including the number of advanced reactors deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, and the Separative Work Unit capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the reactors. Deploying Micro Modular Reactors requires a higher average mass and Separative Work Unit capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, and a lower enriched uranium mass and a higher Separative Work Unity capacity than required to fuel Light Water Reactors before the transition. Fueling Xe-100 reactors requires less enriched uranium and Separative Work Unit capacity than fueling Light Water Reactors before the transition.},

	abstract = {The nuclear power industry must overcome cost and safety challenges to ensure continued
global use and expansion of nuclear energy technology to provide low-carbon electricity
worldwide. The Generation {IV} International Forum identi ed six nuclear reactor systems
that promise signi cant advances in safety, sustainability, e ciency, and cost over existing
designs. The Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor ({FHR}) system, speci cally
the Advanced High Temperature Reactor ({AHTR}) design, combines the best aspects of two
identi ed Generation {IV} systems: Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) and Very-High-Temperature
Reactor ({VHTR}). The {AHTR} uses the {MSR}'s low-pressure liquid fluoride-salt coolant and
{VHTR}'s high-temperature coated-particle fuel. The {AHTR}'s fuel geometry has triple het-
erogeneity, resulting in complex reactor physics and signi cant modeling challenges. To
further understand and address the technical challenges associated with the {AHTR} de-
sign, this work proposes participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development-Nuclear Energy Agency's {FHR} benchmarking exercise by modeling its neutron-

work, I will also explore the impact of additive manufacturing technology advancements
on reactor geometry optimization, speci cally for the {AHTR} design. Leveraging additive
manufacturing technology enables us to surpass classical manufacturing constraints, such as
straight fuel channels or homogenous fuel enrichment, and optimize for arbitrary geometries
and parameters such as non-uniform channel shapes and inhomogeneous fuel distribution
throughout the core. This work proposes to design and demonstrate an optimization tool
that uses the evolutionary algorithm optimization technique with neutron transport and
thermal-hydraulics software to find new optimal reactor geometries enabled by additive
manufacturing technology.},

	url = {https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/106272},
	abstract = {The present United States nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identi ed four classes of nuclear fuel cycle options the U.S could transition to, which would overcome these challenges and make nuclear energy technology more desirable. The transitions have been modeled by various nuclear fuel cycle simulators. However, most fuel cycle simulators require the user to define a deployment
scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid any supply chain gaps, which becomes tedious for complex transition scenarios. This thesis developed a capability in Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle
simulator, to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This new capability successfully deployed fuel cycle facilities in a transition scenario from the current light water reactor fleet to a closed fuel cycle with continuous recycling of transuranics in fast and thermal reactors. In reality, these transition scenarios inevitably diverge from the modeled scenario. This work coupled the nuclear fuel cycle simulator tools, Cyclus and {DYMOND}, with Dakota, a
sensitivity analysis toolkit. This work conducted one-at-a-time, synergistic, and global sensitivity analysis with Cyclus-Dakota and {DYMOND}-Dakota, to understand the interdependence of input
parameters on the transition performance from the current light water reactor 
eet to a closed fuel cycle in which transuranics are recycled to fuel mixed oxide fuel thermal reactors and sodium fast-cooled reactors. The global sensitivity analysis concluded that the transition year input parameter was the most influential to the final depleted uranium and total idle reactor capacity performance
metrics, and the fleet share ratio and cooling time input parameters were the most influential to the final high level waste amount in the simulation. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis showed
that varying transition year from 80 to 84 years increased the final depleted uranium amount by 1.13\% and reduced the total idle reactor capacity by 10.36\%. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis also showed that varying fleet share ratio (mixed oxide fuel light water reactor: sodium fast-cooled reactor) from 0:100 to 20:80 reduced the final high level waste amount by 2\%, and varying the used fuel cooling time from 0 to 8 years reduced the final high level waste amount by 4\%. Therefore, an optimized transition scenario that minimizes final high level waste amount, final depleted uranium amount, and total idle capacity must have a fleet share ratio of 20:80, used fuel cooling time of 8
years, and a transition year at 83 years. This work compared Cyclus-Dakota's and {DYMOND}-Dakota's sensitivity analysis capabilities and concluded that automated deployment of supporting fuel cycle facilities is crucial for conducting sensitivity analyses with nuclear fuel cycle simulators, to ensure that the simulation adapts to the new parameters by minimizing idle reactor capacity.
The results demonstrated that time is saved if a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a nuclear fuel cycle transition scenario begins with a global sensitivity analysis study to gain a general overview of the influential input variables for the performance metrics. Then, based on the global sensitivity analysis results, a reduced number of one-at-a-time and synergistic sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine quantitative trends and impacts of influential input variables on the performance metrics.},

	title = {Multi-Physics and Technical Analysis of High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors for Hydrogen Production},
	rights = {Copyright 2020 Roberto Fairhurst Agosta},
	abstract = {The future energy needs require the development of clean energy sources to ease the increasing environmental concerns. High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors have several desirable features that make them ideal candidates for the near-future large-scale deployment. Some of these features are a high temperature and high thermal cycle efficiency, which enable a wide range of process heat applications, such as hydrogen production. Implementing hydrogen economies can decarbonize the transport and power sectors, offering an alternative to ease climate change.
This work uses Moltres as the primary simulation tool. Although Moltres original development targeted Molten Salt Reactors, this work studies Moltres applicability to multi-physics simulations of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors. Multi-physics simulations are necessary for assessing reactor safety characteristics. Ensuring
Moltres’ multi-physics modeling capabilities requires assessing the independent modeling capabilities of the different physical phenomena. Therefore, this thesis breaks down the analysis into three parts: stand-alone neutronics, stand-alone thermal-fluids, and coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids.
Regarding stand-alone neutronics, several analyses compare the results calculated by Moltres and Serpent on an {MHTGR}-350 model. The first analysis studies the energy group structure effects on the simulation of a fuel column. The results of the study suggest using a 15-energy group structure for attaining a desirable accuracy. The following analysis focuses on the full-core problem and compares different aspects of the simulations, concluding that Moltres obtains reasonably accurate results. The final study on stand-alone neutronics describes Moltres results of Phase I Exercise 1 of the {OECD}/{NEA} {MHTGR}-350 Benchmark. The benchmark exercise proved to be a modeling challenge, requiring the implementation of several approximations. For the most part, this thesis demonstrates Moltres’ capability to simulate stand-alone neutronics of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors.
Regarding stand-alone thermal-fluids, several studies compare Moltres results to previously published results.
These studies focus on local models such as the unit cell and the fuel column problems, for which Moltres temperature results differ by less than 2\% from the published results. Further studies analyze the possibility of extending the thermal-fluids model implemented in the previous problems to a full-core simulation, finding a high memory
requirement imposed by the simulations. The full-core simulations focus on Phase I Exercise 2 of the benchmark, for which the implementation of a two-level approach in Moltres was necessary. The study’s temperatures were within an 11.3\% difference to the published results, concluding that further analysis is required.
Regarding coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids, the analysis describes Phase I Exercise 3 of the benchmark. The exercise uses a simplified model that helps visualize some of the essential aspects of multi-physics simulations in Moltres. This exercise finds some areas of improvement in Moltres’ model and sets a basis for future work.
This thesis aligns with the University of Illinois’ goals to reduce carbon emissions from its campus’s electricity generation and transportation sectors. This work focuses on two main analysis by introducing a nuclear reactor coupled to a hydrogen plant as a solution. The first analysis evaluates the conversion of the university fleet and the mass transit transport system in Urbana-Champaign to Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. The second analysis investigates the duck curve phenomenon in the university’s grid and introduces a mitigation strategy that may reduce the reliance on dispatchable sources. These studies emphasize how nuclear energy and hydrogen production can potentially mitigate climate change.},

I achieved this through three distinct research efforts: 1) furthering our understanding of the {FHR} design’s complexities through neutronics and temperature modeling, 2) creating an open-source tool that enables generative design reactor optimization with evolutionary algorithms, and 3) applying the tool to the {FHR} to optimize for non-conventional geometries and fuel distributions},

	abstract = {Decarbonizing the United States energy system is a challenging task. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of strong federal climate policy, leaving individual states and institutions to drive the energy sector towards net-zero carbon emissions. {ESOM} tools use linear programming to develop policy insights that may help achieve full decarbonization. However, there is a widely recognized tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost. Adding spatial, temporal, and technological details make these models more realistic, but may make them computationally intractable. Previously, most {ESOM} studies prioritize technology options over spatial or temporal detail. This choice emphasizes the role of technology costs, such as fuel and capital costs, on energy policy without considering operational challenges. This thesis uses the {ESOM}, Temoa to model Illinois’ and the University of Illinois’ energy systems and develops the {PyGenesys} tool to facilitate sensitivity analysis. The sensitivities considered in this work are temporal resolution and the annual capacity factors of wind and solar energy, or the inter-annual variability.

The results of the time resolution study showed that any temporal aggregation above an hourly level may generate misleading results that minimizes the roles of firm clean power and energy storage. Additionally, the role of wind energy is overestimated in models with less temporal detail, and the roles of solar energy and advanced nuclear reactors are underestimated. The study of inter-annual variability showed that energy systems with majority variable intermittent renewables, such as solar and wind, that exclude clean firm power from nuclear power plants exhibit higher energy costs with nearly 63 times the variance of systems that use a majority of clean firm power. Additionally, the amount of capacity necessary to meet electricity demand is greater and more uncertain in systems with high renewable penetration. Finally, based on the results in each of the sensitivity analyses, this thesis recommends that Illinois continues supporting its existing nuclear fleet with “zero emissions credits” and expand clean firm capacity with advanced nuclear reactors by lifting the moratorium on new nuclear builds.},

	title = {The State of Play for Nuclear Energy in the United States {\textbar} Briefing {\textbar} {EESI}},
	url = {https://www.eesi.org/briefings/view/041923nuclear},
	abstract = {The Office of Nuclear Energy ({NE}) within the Department of Energy ({DOE}) works to advance nuclear energy science and technology to meet U.S. energy, environmental, and economic needs. {NE} focuses on research and development (R\&D) that prioritizes the continued operation of the current fleet of nuclear reactors, building new reactors, securing and sustaining the nuclear fuel cycle, and expanding international nuclear cooperation.
The R\&D budget of {NE} supports nuclear science and technology missions by national laboratories, universities, and industry.
Stopping the premature closure of existing nuclear power plants due to economic reasons can save gigawatts of clean firm power on the grid.
Nuclear energy is the largest source of carbon-free energy in the United States. It accounts for 18 percent of all electricity generated and 47 percent of all carbon emissions-free electricity in the United States.
R\&D programs enhance the performance of nuclear energy plants, extend their lifetime, reduce operating costs, and develop advanced fuels.
Historically, conventional nuclear power plants run at single power, at baseload, and cannot vary their generation. However, advanced nuclear technology provides many opportunities for reactors to vary in power to complement renewable energy facilities. Advanced nuclear technology also provides thermal storage capabilities that allow reactors to stay at high temperatures while the amount of electricity they dispatch to the grid can vary.
Developing small modular reactors ({SMRs}) and micro-reactors will offer siting flexibility, scalability, and energy uses beyond electricity. With less space required for emergency planning zones, {SMRs} can be more suitable for environments like repurposed retired and retiring fossil fuel plants.
{NE} is developing micro-reactors for off-grid communities and backup power, the kind of situations that diesel generators often address.
There are a number of communities and assets across the country that we cannot leave behind in the transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Nuclear reactors are especially suited to leveraging grid, workforce, and other assets at retiring or retired coal plant sites.
Repurposing unabated fossil plants could deliver place-based solutions to advance an equitable energy transition.
A recent {DOE} study shows that 80 percent of U.S. coal communities could benefit from replacing their coal plants with nuclear ones. Each community could gain 650 new permanent jobs, additional economic activity of \$275 million, and an 86 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Leveraging existing infrastructure would reduce total system costs.
The {DOE} has recently released reports on long-duration energy storage, clean hydrogen, and commercializing advanced nuclear.
To get to the net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal, the buildout of nuclear energy will need to be aggressive. Clean firm power will be necessary to support variable renewable energy.
To secure and sustain the global nuclear fuel cycle, conversion and enrichment capacity must be expanded, a strategy for integrated waste management of spent nuclear fuel must be developed, and consent-based approaches to siting interim storage facilities must be implemented.
A consent-based siting approach would consolidate the 70 locations across the country where communities are currently hosting spent nuclear fuel but never agreed to host it for the long term. The {DOE} was supposed to take title of this fuel in 1988.
This consent-based approach prioritizes people and communities; seeks willing and informed consent; is flexible, adaptive, and collaborative; is responsive to community concerns; centers equity and environmental justice; and is informed by public feedback.
{NE} supports R\&D cooperation across borders to ensure research focuses on peaceful uses of nuclear power as well as to ensure the ability of the United States to have a voice in global leadership on this topic.},

	abstract = {In this talk, Assistant Secretary Huff will provide a potential vision for the future of nuclear power globally and will describe what the federal government, particularly the Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy ({DOE} {NE}), is doing today to bring that vision into reality by 2050. This work includes laying the groundwork for peaceful nuclear power to help the U.S. reach net-zero emissions by 2050, for securing and sustaining both the front and back ends of our nuclear fuel cycle and for expanding international nuclear energy cooperation. This talk will highlight the {DOE} {NE} mission, vision and programs contributing to these goals as well as the opportunities and challenges ahead. These challenges and opportunities include a need to mobilize bold private capital investments, scale-up a skilled workforce, revive and invent critical supply chains and underpin it all with processes and policies that consider equity and justice.},

We implemented the approach into a hypothetical channel of molten salt reactors to demonstrate the applicability of the method. We prepared a Python tool, named Plankton, which couples to a reactor physics code and an optimization tool, and imports {ML} methods. The tool performs three consecutive phases: reactor database generation, machine learning application, and design optimization. We identified the extra trees method as the best performing estimator. With the estimator, we found nine optimum designs in total, one for each fuel-salt pair, and estimated all the performance metrics of the designs with a {\textless}5\% prediction error compared to their actual values. U-Pu-{NaCl} fuel-salt gave promising results with the highest conversion ratio, the most negative feedback coefficient, and the lowest fast flux.},

Critically, our simulations incorporate novel technologies like hydrogen electrolysers, carbon capture, photochemical water splitting, and emerging photovoltaic cells, assess long-term impacts up to the year 2100, and include life-cycle emissions and learning curves for parameters such as investment cost, efficiency, and emission coefficients. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, using nuclear power and hydrogen from renewable energy-based electrolysis, is cost-effective and provides long-term emission reduction along with energy security. Nuclear, wind, solar, and hydrogen from renewables emerge as key emission reduction technologies, while natural gas with carbon capture plays a minor role in achieving emission reduction targets.},

This research investigates people’s lived experience and preferences through a nationally representative survey (n = 3000) regarding the energy system, and how these relate to cultural group and other demographics. Our study highlights the influence of cultural background in the {US}, alongside educational achievement and income level on perceptions toward the energy system and energy policy. Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational achievement. For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural grouping. Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and energy system factors compared to their peers. Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment, and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition justice outcomes.},

	abstract = {Science gateways are a crucial component of critical infrastructure as they provide the means for users to focus on their topics and methods instead of the technical details of the infrastructure. They are defined as end-to-end solutions for accessing data, software, computing services, sensors, and equipment specific to the needs of a science or engineering discipline and their goal is to hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. Science gateways are often called Virtual Research Environments in Europe and Virtual Labs in Australasia; we consider these two terms to be synonymous with science gateways. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence ({AI}) and machine learning ({ML}) have found applications in many different fields in private industry, and private industry has reaped the benefits. Likewise, in the academic realm, large-scale data science applications have also learned to apply public high-performance computing resources to make use of this technology. However, academic and research science gateways have yet to fully adopt the tools of {AI}. There is an opportunity in the gateways space, both to increase the visibility and accessibility to {AI}/{ML} applications and to enable researchers and developers to advance the field of science gateway cyberinfrastructure itself. Harnessing {AI}/{ML} is recognized as a high priority by the science gateway community. It is, therefore, critical for the next generation of science gateways to adapt to support the {AI}/{ML} that is already transforming many scientific fields. The goal is to increase collaborations between the two fields and to ensure that gateway services are used and are valuable to the {AI}/{ML} community. This chapter presents state-of-the-art examples and areas of opportunity for the science gateways community to pursue in relation to {AI}/{ML} and some vision of where these new capabilities might impact science gateways and support scientific research.},

	abstract = {Fuel cycle simulator development started many years ago by several research and engineering institutions or consulting firms for a wide range of applications. To improve confidence in the results, institutions may be tempted to increase the complexity of their software even if this complexity might not be necessary. On the other hand, some simulators may be used outside their range of validity when used in very specific applications. The {FIT} (Functionality Isolation Test) project is an international effort devoted to improve the confidence in the data produced by fuel cycle simulation tools. The scientific goal is to determine the optimum level of detail a fuel cycle simulator needs according to the type of study and the required confidence level. The project relies on a wide variety of fuel cycle simulators with a large range of complexity levels. The {FIT} project consists of isolating the impact of one targeted functionality on fuel cycle simulations. The impact of the functionality is assessed using a set of simple basic exercises specifically designed for this purpose, called ”functionality isolation.” The present work focuses on the impact on simulation results of using a fuel loading model (a relation that links the stock isotopic composition with the fresh fuel fabrication according to the reactor requirements) or a fixed fraction approach (the fresh fuel fissile fraction is fixed and does not depend on the stock isotopic composition). The paper first presents the {FIT} project. The exercise design is described and results show that using a fuel loading model approach has an important impact on fuel cycle outputs under certain conditions that are described. This result is reinforced by the fact that all fuel cycle simulators used in this exercise provide similar conclusions.},

	title = {Enabling Load Following Capability in the Transatomic Power {MSR}},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1877339},
	abstract = {This project is dedicated towards designing a fuel processing system that enables liquid-fueled molten salt reactors ({MSR}) to load follow by removing the dissolved xenon in the fuel salt. As one of the Gen-{IV} nuclear reactor concepts, the molten salt reactor receives increasing development interests in the recent years. One distinguishing feature of the liquid-fueled molten salt reactor is its improved ability to operate in a load-following mode by including the unique online fission product removal system. Load-following means that the reactor changes its power output based on the demand on the grid. Most of the current operating nuclear reactors have limited load-following ability and operate as the base load on the grid. Due to the rapid increase of solar energy, the requirement on load-following capacity is significantly increased because of the varying power output of the solar panels, yet the traditional load-following capacity is expected to decrease as the decarbonization of the grid continues. Therefore, the ability to perform load-following operation for the nuclear reactors will greatly enhance the resilience of the grid and make nuclear energy more economically competitive. This load-following feature is included in many commercial molten salt reactor designs, such as the designs by Transatomic Power, Terrestrial Energy, and Flibe Energy. Unfortunately, detailed analysis of the fuel processing system for commercial scale {MSRs} is still lacking, as well as how the fuel processing quantitively impacts the load-following operation. Moreover, experimental data for many of the underlying physics of fuel processing is limited. This project aims to pave the way for the fuel processing technology to advance to the commercial stage by performing combined experimental and simulation research. During the project period, four interconnected aspects of the development of the fuel processing system in liquid-fueled molten salt reactors are investigated. These aspects are the simulation and analysis of the fission product removal system, the fuel cycle simulation, the coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation, and the gaseous fission product removal experiment. Multiphase {CFD} simulations are performed for components of the processing systems, and simplified air-water experiments are carried out to provide validation data. It is concluded that the {CFD} simulation can satisfactorily predict the system level performance of the components, and engineering models are constructed based on this success. Fuel cycle analysis is performed for two representative {MSR} design, the {MSBR} and the Transatomic Power {MSR}. Open-source code {SaltProc} is developed to incorporate the unique fuel processing system of the {MSRs}. It is concluded that the removal of xenon is essential for load-following operation in thermal spectrum {MSR} and Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. For the Transatomic Power {MSR}, the xenon poisoning effect is negligible due to its relatively fast neutron spectrum, though the overall fuel cycle economics still benefits from the removal of xenon. Coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation is performed specifically for the Transatomic Power {MSR}. It is concluded that the reactor core design could perform power ramping fast enough to satisfy load-following operation. Combining the findings from each aspect, it is concluded that the load-following operation of a thermal neutron {MSR} is dependent upon the removal of xenon, which could be achieved for a commercial sized reactor using continuous inert gas sparging in a separate system with reasonable dimensions.},

	abstract = {Methods for deep-penetration radiation transport remain important for radiation shielding, nonproliferation, nuclear threat reduction, and medical applications. As these applications become more ubiquitous, the need for accurate and reliable transport methods appropriate for these systems persists. For such systems, hybrid methods often obtain reliable answers in the shortest time by leveraging the speed and uniform uncertainty distribution of a deterministic solution to bias Monte Carlo transport and reduce the variance in the solution. This work reviews the state of the art among such hybrid methods. First, we summarize variance reduction ({VR}) for Monte Carlo radiation transport and existing efforts to automate these techniques. Relations among {VR}, importance, and the adjoint solution of the neutron transport equation are then discussed. Based on this exposition, the work transitions from theory to a critical review of existing {VR} implementations in modern nuclear engineering software. At present, the Consistent {AdjointDriven} Importance Sampling ({CADIS}) and Forward-Weighted Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling ({FW}-{CADIS}) hybrid methods are the gold standard by which to reduce the variance in problems that have deeply penetrating radiation. The {CADIS} and {FW}-{CADIS} methods use an adjoint scalar flux to generate {VR} parameters for Monte Carlo radiation transport. Additionally, efforts to incorporate angular information into {VR} methods for Monte Carlo are summarized. Finally, we assess various implementations of these methods and the degree to which they improve {VR} for their target applications.},

	abstract = {The University of California, Berkeley; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and
University of Wisconsin, Madison, hosted a series of four workshops during 2012 under a U.S.
Department of Energy-sponsored Integrated Research Project ({IRP}) to review technical and
licensing issues for fluoride-salt-cooled, high-temperature reactors ({FHRs}). This white paper
reports results from the fourth and final workshop, discusses functional requirements and goals
for an {FHR} test reactor ({FHTR}), and recommends a scaling approach to address these functional
requirements and goals. This approach includes ways to maximize the information that an {FHTR}
can produce to predict the operational reliability of commercial-scale plants, as well as their
response to licensing basis events. This workshop also provided input for drafting an {FHR}
development roadmap, which will be issued in the third year of this {IRP}. Finally, this workshop
helped identify the institutional challenges that must be addressed in the roadmap—including the
commercialization strategy and the fuel cycle. The four workshops provided an opportunity to
receive critical feedback from technical experts in relevant fields.
The four workshops are a central element of developing an {FHR} preliminary conceptual
design report to be completed in 2014. This fourth white paper focuses on material covered by
the fourth workshop and is divided into five main chapters and a series of appendices. The first
chapter provides an overview of the {FHR} workshop series, {FHR} development goals and
commercialization challenges. The second chapter describes an {FHR} development and
commercialization strategy. The third chapter reviews preparatory activities needed to develop
an {FHTR}, while the fourth chapter discusses major design and licensing requirements for it. The
fifth discusses the commercialization roadmap. Appendices elaborate on certain issues in the
second through fifth chapters.
The comments of the experts attending the workshop, who are listed on the title page, were
also integrated into this white paper. The {IRP} team sincerely appreciates the input of all of the
experts who attended and contributed to the fourth {FHR} workshop, as well as the hard work of
the graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who organized it, facilitated the sessions, and
drafted the major sections of this white paper based on their research and the review and input of
the workshop experts},

As part of a wider effort to bring yt to the geosciences, we present an initial use-case of yt applied to 3D seismic tomography models of the upper mantle from the {IRIS} Earth Model Collaboration. While the rendering capabilities of yt can in general be applied directly to 3D geoscience data, we add several graphical elements to the 3D rendering to aid in interpretation of volume renderings including latitude/longitude overlays and shapefile suport for plotting political and tectonic boundaries along the Earth’s surface. In this notebook, we focus on tomographic models of North America and the Western U.S., where high resolution models and rapidly varying seismic properties provide a rich dataset to explore systematically at a range of lengthscales. The notebook demonstrates loading and rendering of {IRIS} netcdf models, highlighting interesting 3D features of the Western U.S. upper mantle, and goes on to demonstrate how having direct control of the transfer functions used in creating the final volume rendering allows for a more systematic exploration of the role of the visualization method in our interpretation of 3D volumetric data. Finally, we conclude by demonstrating some of the semantically-aware capabilities of yt for analysis purposes, and demonstrate how these tools have cross-disciplinary functionality.},

	abstract = {The chronology of the Solar System, particularly the timing of formation of extra-terrestrial bodies and their features, is an outstanding problem in planetary science. Although various chronological methods for in situ geochronology have been proposed (e.g., Rb-Sr, K-Ar), and even applied (K-Ar), the reliability, accuracy, and applicability of the 40Ar/39Ar method makes it by far the most desirable chronometer for dating extra-terrestrial bodies. The method however relies on the neutron irradiation of samples, and thus a neutron source. Herein, we discuss the challenges and feasibility of deploying a passive neutron source to planetary surfaces for the in situ application of the 40Ar/39Ar chronometer. Requirements in generating and shielding neutrons, as well as analysing samples are described, along with an exploration of limitations such as mass, power and cost. Two potential solutions for the in situ extra-terrestrial deployment of the 40Ar/39Ar method are presented. Although this represents a challenging task, developing the technology to apply the 40Ar/39Ar method on planetary surfaces would represent a major advance towards constraining the timescale of solar system formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {The 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dating technique is an attractive option for future extraterrestrial geochronology applications. However, in situ 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dating on Mars presents unique challenges to the design of a device capable of achieving sufficient precision on geological samples obtained on the Martian surface. For this application, a fast neutron source with a low thermal neutron flux is ideal for inducing the 39K(n,p)39Ar reaction with few competing reactions that require age-correction factors. This paper explores the design of a neutron emitting device specifically for in situ geochronological applications on extraterrestrial surfaces. We have determined that a feasible design is likely to include a 252Cf spontaneous fission source shielded by polyethylene layered with a strong thermal neutron absorber. Although boosting options-induced fission sources, (α,n)-are available, they do not provide sufficient neutron multiplicity to justify the increased mass of the device. Furthermore, shielding the rover from the neutron source will likely comprise the largest fractional mass of the device, which will be reduced by shielding only a small solid angle of the source. While we have determined that it is possible to design such a neutron source, there will also be other instrumentation competing for a mass fraction of the Rover instrument payload. This may make it difficult to design a device that achieves the required mass and fluence limitations for a future mission. However, this work provides a realistic path forward in determining a future workable design. Copyright © (2015) by the American Nuclear Society All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The United States is considering the deployment of advanced reactors that require uranium enriched between 5-20\% 235U, often referred to as High Assay Low Enriched Uranium ({HALEU}). At the present, there are no commercial facilities in the {US} to produce {HALEU}, prompting questions of how to create a dependable supply chain of {HALEU} to support these reactors. {HALEU} can be produced through two primary methods: downblending High Enriched Uranium ({HEU}) and enriching natural uranium. The amount of {HEU} available and impurities present in the {HEU} limit downblending capabilities. The Separative Work Unit ({SWU}) capacity and amount of natural uranium available limit enriching natural uranium capabilities. To understand the resources necessary to commercially produce {HALEU} with each of these methods, one can quantify the material requirements of transitioning to {HALEU}-fueled reactors. 

In this dissertation, we model the transition from Light Water Reactors to different advanced reactors, considering once-through and closed fuel cycles to determine material requirements for supporting these fuel cycles. Material requirements of interest across this work include the mass of enriched uranium, mass of {HALEU}, feed uranium, {SWU} capacity, and the mass of used fuel sent for disposal. We use {CYCLUS} and publicly-available information about Light Water Reactors, the X-energy Xe-100, the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor, and the {NuScale} {VOYGR} to model potential transition scenarios and demonstrate the methodologies developed in this work. To more accurately model the closed fuel cycles, we develop a new {CYCLUS} archetype, called {OpenMCyclus}, that couples with {OpenMC} to dynamically model fuel depletion in a reactor and provide more accurate used fuel compositions. The results of this transition analysis show how the characteristics of the advanced reactors deployed drive the materials required to support the fuel cycle. Closing the fuel cycle reduces the materials required, but the reduction in materials is driven by the amount of material available for reprocessing. 

To gain more insight into how transition parameters not considered in the transition analysis affect material requirements, we perform sensitivity analysis on one of the once-through transitions by coupling {CYCLUS} with Dakota. The results of the sensitivity analysis highlight some of the trade-offs between different reactor designs. One such tradeoff is the increased {HALEU} demand but decreased used fuel discharged when increasing the Xe-100 deployment and decreasing the {VOYGR} deployment. Additionally, these results identify the Xe-100 discharge burnup as consistently being one of the most impactful input parameters for this transition, because of how the deployment scheme in this work affects the number of Xe-100s built no matter which advanced reactor build share is specified.

To identify potential transitions that minimize material requirements, we then use the {CYCLUS}-Dakota to optimize a once-through transition using the genetic algorithms in Dakota. In single-objective problems to minimize the {SWU} capacity required to produce {HALEU} and minimize the amount of used nuclear fuel, the algorithm finds solutions that are consistent with the results of the sensitivity analysis. The results cannot be taken at face value, because the algorithm did not fully converge and the genetic algorithms do not enforce the applied linear constraint for the advanced reactor build shares to sum to 100\%. However, the results provide guidance on how to adjust the input parameters to optimize the transition for a minimal {HALEU} {SWU} or the used fuel mass. Parameter adjustments include maximizing the number of Light Water Reactors that receive license extensions to operate for 80 years. Similar results occur when using this method for a multi-objective problem to minimize both the {HALEU} {SWU} capacity and the used fuel mass. 

Finally, we use neutronics models of the Xe-100 and Micro Modular Reactor reactor designs to evaluate the steady-state reactor physics performance of downblended {HEU} in these two designs. We compare the performance of the downblended {HEU} to nominally enriched fuel, based on the k-eff, βeff, energy- and spatially-dependent neutron fluxes, as well as the fuel, moderator, coolant, and total reactivity temperature feedback coefficients. The differences in the fuel compositions leads to differences in each of the metrics. However, these differences are within error of the results of the nominally enriched fuel, or would not prevent the reactor from meeting stated design specifications or operating in a safe state.

The work completed in this dissertation develops and demonstrates a methodology for modeling fuel cycle transitions and understanding the effects of deploying {HALEU}-fueled reactors in the {US}. The effects investigated in these example scenarios include various materials and resources required to support these reactors, and how the parameters of the transition affect these requirements. The information generated from this new methodology can be used to develop the necessary infrastructure and supply chains for support a transition to {HALEU}-fueled reactors. Furthermore, this work explores how the {HALEU} production method (enriching compared with downblending) affects reactor performance.},

Gross reactivity control is provided by variations of the refuel rate of the reactor. Fine reactivity adjustments are expected to be done with control mechanisms in real-life power operation. The Python library developed allows a user to set bounds on the desired ke f f value. Fuel oxidation potential must be controlled for any liquid fueled reactor. As a simple example, consider this fission where the fuel becomes more oxidizing: {UF}\{sub 4\} → {SrF}\{sub 2\} + Xe + 2F\{sup -\} It can be shown using expected fission product oxidation state data that for these reactors, the fuel will become more oxidizing over time as a result of accumulation of excess fluoride ion. Addition of a reducing agent to reactor fuel will be necessary in the operation of molten salt reactors.},

	abstract = {Liquid fueled molten salt reactor modeling can be challenging, as the fuel composition varies temporally and spatially. Although these models are challenging, they are important for predicting reactor safety and performance during operation. One of the reasons these models are challenging is the difficulty in capturing different physical phenomena which occur in different time scales. Over short time scales, one of these physical phenomena is the movement of delayed neutron precursors to less important regions of the reactor.
For longer time scales, one of these physical phenomena is online reprocessing, which includes adding fresh fuel and removing fission products from the reactor during operation and is the focus of this work. Reprocessing is useful in liquid fueled molten salt reactors because it limits chemical corrosion and improves the neutron economy. Reprocessing can be performed continuously during operation, referred to as online reprocessing, or in batches during outages, referred to as batchwise reprocessing. In order to simulate reprocessing computationally, there are two different mathematical approaches which are commonly implemented in the literature, called batchwise and continuous reprocessing. The continuous reprocessing method is more physically reflective of reactors using a chemically continuous reprocessing scheme. However, there are many works which have implemented batchwise reprocessing methods to simulate a physically continuous reprocessing process. In this thesis, I show that continuous reprocessing and batchwise reprocessing methods are not interchangeable. Using both methods on the same system shows that there are non-trivial differences in the results. I also investigate the computational cost of different reprocessing methods by performing a depletion time step refinement study. In this study, I found that continuous reprocessing allows for significantly larger time steps without large increases in error, which reduces computational cost. However, continuous reprocessing does not necessarily keep the overall mass constant, thus potentially leading to a nonphysical solution. I compare the differences between both methods while determining the effect of this nonphysical mass change caused by continuous reprocessing.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in the study of coupled plasma-liquid systems because of their applications to biomedicine, biological and chemical disinfection, agriculture, and other areas. Optimizing these applications requires a fundamental understanding of the coupling between phases. Though much progress has been made in this regard, there is still more to be done. One area that requires more research is the transport of electrons across the plasma-liquid interface. Some pioneering works (Rumbach et al 2015 Nat. Commun. 6, Rumbach et al 2015 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 48 424001) have begun revealing the near-surface liquid characteristics of electrons. However, there has been little work to determine the near-surface gas phase electron characteristics. Without an understanding of the near-surface gas dynamics, modellers are left to make assumptions about the interfacial conditions. For instance it is commonly assumed that the surface loss or sticking coefficient of gas-phase electrons at the interface is equal to 1. In this work we explore the consequences of this assumption and introduce a couple of ways to think about the electron interfacial condition. In one set of simulations we impose a kinetic condition with varying surface loss coefficient on the gas phase interfacial electrons. In a second set of simulations we introduce a Henry's law like condition at the interface in which the gas-phase electron concentration is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the liquid-phase electron concentration. It is shown that for a range of electron Henry coefficients spanning a range of known hydrophilic specie Henry coefficients, the gas phase electron density in the anode can vary by orders of magnitude. Varying reflection of electrons by the interface also has consequences for the electron energy profile; increasing reflection may lead to increasing thermalization of electrons depending on choices about the electron energy boundary condition. This variation in anode electron density and energy as a function of the interface characteristics could also lead to significant variation in near-surface gas chemistries when such reactions are included in the model; this could very well in turn affect the reactive species impinging on the liquid surface. We draw the conclusion that in order to make more confident model predictions about plasma-liquid systems, finer scale simulations and/or new experimental techniques must be used to elucidate the near-surface gas phase electron dynamics.},

Plasma-liquids have exciting applications to several important socioeconomic areas, including
agriculture, water treatment, and medicine. To realize their application potential, the basic
physical and chemical phenomena of plasma-liquid systems must be better understood. Additionally, system designs must be optimized in order to maximize fluxes of critical plasma species
to the liquid phase. With objectives to increase understanding of these systems and optimize
their applications, we have performed both comprehensive modelling and experimental work. To
date, models of plasma-liquids have focused on configurations where diffusion is the dominant
transport process in both gas and liquid phases. However, convection plays a key role in many
popular plasma source designs, including jets, corona discharges, and torches. In this dissertation,
we model momentum, heat, and neutral species mass transfer in a convection-dominated system
based on a corona discharge. We show that evaporative cooling produced by gas-phase convection
can lead to a significant difference between gas and liquid phase bulk temperatures. Additionally,
convection induced in the liquid phase by the gas phase flow substantially increases interfacial
mass transfer of hydrophobic species like {NO} and {NO}2. Finally, liquid kinetic modelling suggests that concentrations of highly reactive species like {OH} and {ONOOH} are several orders of
magnitude higher at the interface than in the solution bulk.
Subsequent modelling has focused on coupling discharge physics with species transport at and
through the interface. An assumption commonly seen in the literature is that interfacial loss
coefficients of charged species like electrons are equal to unity. However, there is no experimental
evidence to either deny or support this assumption. Without knowing the true interfacial behavior
of electrons, we have explored the effects on key plasma-liquid variables of varying interfacial
parameters like the electron and energy surface loss coefficients. Within a reasonable range for
these parameters, we have demonstrated that the electron density on the gas phase side of the
interface can vary by orders of magnitude. Significant effects can also be seen on the gas phase
interfacial electron energy. Electron density and energy will play important roles in determining
gas phase chemistry in more complex future models; this will in turn feed back into the liquid
phase chemistry. To remove this uncertainty in interfacial behavior, we recommend finer scale
atomistic or molecular dynamics simulations. Efficient coupling of the highly non-linear discharge
physics equations to liquid transport required creation of a new simulation code named Zapdos,
built on top of the {MOOSE} framework. The operation and capabilities of the code are described
in this work. Moreover, changes made to the {MOOSE} framework allowing coupling of physics
across subdomain boundaries, necessary for plasma-liquid coupling, are also detailed.
In the latter half of this work, we investigate experimental optimization and characterization of
plasma-liquid interactions surrounding a unique very high frequency ({VHF}) plasma discharge.
Several geometric configurations are considered. In the most promising set-up, the discharge
is pointed upwards and water is pumped through the source’s inner conductor until it forms
a milimeter thick water layer on top of the powered electrode. This maximizes the amount of
charged and neutral species flux received by the aqueous phase as well as the amount of water
vapor created in the gas phase. Additionally, the configuration eliminates electrode damage by
providing an infinitely renewable liquid surface layer. The presence of large amounts of water
vapor and {OH} radicals is confirmed by optical emission and broadband absorption spectroscopy.
Characterization of liquid phase species like {NO}−
3
, {NO}−
2
, and H2O2 is carried out through ion
chromatography ({IC}) and colorimetric measurements.
After detailing the design and characterization of our plasma-liquid systems, we illustrate their
applications to plant fertilization and wastewater disinfection. In a four-week collaborative experiment with the {NCSU} greenhouse, plants that received plasma-treated water grew significantly
larger than plants that received tap water. This is directly attributable to the approximately
hundred mg/L of {NO}−
3 dissolved into solution by the plasma. The {VHF} source also proved
effective at removing several aqueous contaminants designated harmful to humans by the {EPA}.
Air plasma treatment of solutions contaminated with 1,4-dioxane showed log reduction times
competitive with other advanced oxidative processes ({AOP}). Argon treatment of dixoane was an
order of magnitude more effective in terms of log reduction time, although the associated costs
are significantly higher. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ({PFOS}) proved resistant to several {VHF}
design iterations. However, the water electrode design introduced in the passage above achieved a
log reduction in low level {PFOS} concentrations over the course of twenty five minutes, suggesting
that it may be viable as an advanced technology for degradation of persistent perfluorinated
compounds.
Future work will serve to further unify the modelling and experimental work presented here.

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Coupled plasma-liquid systems are at the heart of several burgeoning applications in low-temperature plasma science, including biomedicine, biological and chemical disinfection, agriculture, and others. In order to realize the full potential of these applications, the basic underlying physical and chemical phenomena must be understood. Recent modeling [1] and experimental [2] work have done much to elucidate system behavior but more questions remain, particularly in the interfacial region. The surface loss probability of gas phase electrons striking the interface, a critical parameter for many plasma simulations, is unknown; to date authors have generally assumed a value of unity, however there is no experimental evidence to either support or discourage this choice. The modeling work presented here explores the effects of varying key interfacial parameters. Two alternative interfacial models for electrons are considered: a kinetic one employing a surface loss probability, and a thermodynamic one in which the gas phase electron density is assumed to be in equilibrium with the liquid phase electron density with a ratio specified by a Henry's Law like coefficient (H). It is shown that if H is decreased from 106 ( H for hydrogen peroxide) to 102 ( H for hydroxyl radical), the gas phase electron density at the interface increases by three orders of magnitude. Moreover, if reflected electrons are still assumed to deposit their energy at the interface through collisions like vibrational excitation of surface molecules, then increasing reflection not only increases the density of gas phase electrons, but it also decreases the average energy of the electrons in the interfacial region. This could have significant impacts on both gas and liquid chemistry, e.g. the presence of a large number of colder electrons could lead to a large amount of electron attachment and production of negative ions in the near-interface region. The variability of key plasma variables like electron density and electron energy with respect to assumptions about the interface should motivate molecular scale simulations and/or new experimental diagnostics capable of probing the plasma in the near interface region.},

	abstract = {Nuclear research reactors enable a wide range of applications and support the development of multiple fields, including energy production, isotope production, space discovery, among others. Research reactor safety analyses demonstrate the contribution of the operational procedures to the prevention of accidents, focusing mainly on the reactor core. These analyses rely on the assumption of heat being locally deposited in the core after shutdown. This work, however, is concerned with research reactor experiments, and it investigates more detailed methods targeting the specific reactor regions hosting the experiments.

Additionally, research reactor experiments require the development of individual experiment safety analyses, which due to the lack of a streamlined workflow becomes effort and time-consuming as well as error-prone. This thesis supports the development of safety analyses for research reactor experiments with the objective of streamlining the calculation procedure as well as accelerating it. The methodology presented here calculates the delayed heating in experiments, generates the volumetric heat source term for thermal-fluids calculations, solves the experiment temperature evolution during a channel draining event, and determines if the event leads to a radioactive material release. Moreover, this work examines methods to accelerate the calculation, which include the creation of a generic material irradiation database and data-based modeling.

This thesis starts with a literature survey summarizing previous work relevant to delayed heating calculations, transport/depletion solvers, and machine learning applied to nuclear engineering. The conclusions of the survey guide the choice of methods for the delayed heating calculation and the choice of machine learning algorithms for the data-based modeling.

The following chapters focus on the calculation workflows. This thesis establishes a delayed heating calculation workflow based on the formal three-step method that builds on top of the {MCNP}-{ORIGEN} Activation Automation ({MOAA}) tool. This workflow is demonstrated and verified with several exercises, which also ease the workflow visualization. The workflow is also demonstrated in two full-size research reactors, for which the heat in the structures and an experiment are calculated.

A simple modification of the delayed heating calculation workflow generates a shutdown dose rate calculation workflow as a value-added. This calculation workflow helps guide the post-irradiation examination ({PIE}) of experiments and helps prevent the unnecessary exposure of personnel and surrounding equipment. The calculation workflow is demonstrated for a Tristructural Isotropic ({TRISO})-fueled experiment which highlights the applicability of this workflow to more complex geometries, such as High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors ({HTGRs}).

When focusing on the acceleration of the calculations, this thesis proposes the generic material irradiation database method. This method relies on the delayed heating calculation workflow to obtain the heat produced in experiments of individual chemical elements and through their combination calculate the heat produced in experiments of arbitrary material composition. This thesis verifies this method by studying a vast range of materials that could be used in a research reactor experiment.

Moreover, this thesis investigates the applicability of data-based modeling to predict the outcome of the most thermally challenging accident in an experiment, a channel draining event. The data preparation process and several machine learning algorithms are described before studying a simplified model. Several useful conclusions are drawn with the simplified model before scaling it up, with some minor modifications, to a full-size reactor experiment.

Finally, this thesis wraps up with the conclusions from all the previous calculations. Overall, the results presented in this thesis meet this thesis’ objectives and prove that the proposed methodology decreases the computational expense and enables quick calculations supporting research reactor experiments.},

	abstract = {The ability to characterize used nuclear fuel ({UNF}) is important for nuclear nonproliferation safeguards, criticality safety, and fuel storage. Multiple efforts have been made to estimate the burnup ({BU}), initial enrichment ({IE}), and cooling time ({CT}) based on multivariate models of isotopic concentrations and radiation signatures of the fuel. This work provides a comparison of multivariate modeling techniques and extends previous work by quantifying the uncertainty of the best model to predict each characteristic. Model inputs used are simulated gamma and neutron emissions from {UNF} of varying {BU}, {IE}, and {CT}. Modeling techniques explored include Ordinary Least Squares Regression ({OLS}), Principal Component Regression ({PCR}), and Partial Least Squares Regression ({PLS}). Multiple {PCR} and {PLS} models were built based on different variable selection methods, such as cross validation and Akaike Information Criteria. The {OLS} model predictions have a root mean square percent error ({RMSPE}) of less than 10\%, but the models are very unstable. The {PCR} models exhibit a trade-off between accurate and stable predictions. The best performing {PCR} and {PLS} models have similar predictions errors, but the {PLS} models are favored due to their stability. The best model for each characteristic is a single output {PLS} model based on cross validation. The uncertainty of each of these models, based on their prediction variance and biases, is 0.220 {GWd}/{MTU}, 0.051\% U-235, and 0.694 years for the {BU}, {IE}, and {CT} models, respectively. By building a 95\% prediction interval based on the corresponding uncertainty of each characteristic, 1.97\% of the {BU} predictions, 23.03\% of the {IE} predictions, and 100\% of the {CT} predictions lack 95\% confidence that they are within the prescribed accuracy requirement for the characteristic.},

	url = {https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_gradthes/6272},
	abstract = {For nuclear nonproliferation safeguards, the ability to characterize used nuclear fuel ({UNF})
is a vital process. Fuel characterization allows for independent verification by inspectors
of operator declarations of the special nuclear material flow and nuclear related activities
within a facility, and an estimation of fissile material remaining in a fuel assembly. Current
methods to verify this information rely heavily on non-destructive assay techniques, such
as gamma spectroscopy and neutron detection measurements. While these measurements
are effective tools for estimating a specific characteristic of the fuel, such as burnup or
cooling time, they often require an accurate estimation of a select few isotopes in the
fuel. This requirement means that the characterization is based on a very small amount
of information that is contained in radiation emissions. To help overcome this limitation,
this work investigates the use of empirical modeling to predict the burnup, initial enrichment,
and cooling time of a Westinghouse 17x17 {UNF} assembly. This technique utilizes the
entire spectrum of gamma emissions and gross neutron counts to predict each output to
explore the full suite of information contained in these signatures. Three primary parametric
modeling techniques are investigated for their performance in modeling this system: Ordinary
Least Squares Regression ({OLS}), Principal Component Regression ({PCR}), and Partial Least
Squares Regression ({PLS}). The models created are evaluated based on their root mean square
percent error and condition number. The uncertainty of the best performing model is then
quantified to understand the prediction interval of the predicted characterization and how
this compares to the uncertainty of current measurement and characterization techniques.
The {PLS} models are able to provide the best predictions while being stable. The {PCR} models
have a consistent trade-off between accurate prediction results and stability. The {OLS} model
provides fairly accurate results but is highly unstable due to correlations in the input data.
The best model is the {PLS} model based on cross validation because it is stable, yields the
lowest {RMSPE} values for burnup and enrichment predictions, and yields the second lowest
percent of cooling time predictions that are more than 1 year away from the actual value.
When used with the validation data set, this model yields {RMSPE} values of 0.42\%, 1.39\%
and 4.61\% for the burnup, enrichment, and cooling time, respectively. The total uncertainty
of the predictions of this model are calculated to be 0.220 {GWd}/{MTU}, 0.051\% U-235, and
0.694 years, for the burnup, enrichment, and cooling time, respectively.},

	abstract = {This study presents a cross-disciplinary reactor-to-repository framework to compare different advanced reactors with respect to their spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}). The framework consists of (1) {OpenMC} for simulating neutronics, fuel depletion, and radioactive decays; (2) {NWPY} for computing the repository footprint for {SNF} disposal given the thermal constraints; and (3) {PFLOTRAN} for simulating radionuclide transport in the geosphere to compute the peak dose rate, which is used to quantify the repository performance and environmental impact. We first perform the meta-analysis of past comparative analyses to identify the factors led previously to inconsistent conclusions. We then demonstrate the new framework by comparing five reactor types. Significant findings are that (1) the repository footprint is neither linearly related to {SNF} volume nor to decay heat, due to the repository's thermal constraint, (2) fast reactors have significantly higher I-129 inventory, which is often the primarily dose contributor from repositories, and (3) the repository performance primarily depends on the waste forms. The {TRISO}-based reactors, in particular, have significantly higher {SNF} volumes, but result in smaller repository footprints and lower peak dose rates. Our analysis highlights the diversity of these reactors, each of which should be evaluated individually. The open-source framework ensures proper cross-disciplinary connections between reactor simulations and environmental assessments, as well as the transparency/traceability required for such comparative analyses. It aims to support reactor designers, repository developers and policy makers in evaluating the impact of different reactor designs, with the ultimate goal of improving the sustainability of nuclear energy systems.},

	abstract = {Oak Ridge National Laboratory ({ORNL}) has identified a number of previously reported1,2 technical factors impacting the implementation of safeguards for Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}), which include: (1) the homogeneous mixture of fuel, coolant, fission products ({FPs}), and actinides; (2) continuous variation of isotopic concentrations in the fuel salt, including removal (passive or active) of {FPs}, rare earth elements, and noble metals; (3) the potential for online reprocessing whereby some fraction of the inventory can be removed while the reactor is operational; (4) unique refueling schemes, including the ability to continuously feed the core with fresh fissile or fertile material; and (5) the need for measurements to occur in high-radiation, high-dose, high-temperature environments. These factors necessitate the use of advanced modeling and simulation for tracking the isotopic masses and signatures (i.e., chemical, elemental, isotopic, and radiation) throughout the reactor and associated auxiliary processing, and importantly, tracking must be accomplished as a function of time as the fuel salt evolves during reactor and fuel cycle operations. Determining what needs to be measured, what can be observed, and where to make the measurement(s) are the first steps towards the development of the safeguards technology for the {MSR} family of reactors.},

Square pitch unit cell geometry was used in the calculations. In the bubble model, spherical and non-spherical bubbles at random positions, sizes and shapes were produced by Monte Carlo method. The results show that there are significant differences among the proposed models from the viewpoint of physical interaction mechanism. For the fully-developed bubbly flow, kinf is overestimated in the ring model by about 720 ± 6 pcm with respect to homogeneous model whereas underestimated in the bubble model by about −65 ± 9 pcm with a standard deviation of 15 pcm. In addition, the ring model shows that the coolant must be separated into regions to properly represent the radial void distribution. Deviations in flux distributions principally occur in certain regions, such as corners. As a result, the bubble model in modeling the void fraction can be used in nuclear engineering calculations.},

	abstract = {Under in-vessel retention ({IVR}), one of the main threats to vessel integrity is the focusing effect that may be caused by a thin metallic layer. However, the assessment of the ensuing heat loads on the vessel wall remains fraught with uncertainties, thus making a deterministic demonstration of {IVR}'s success very challenging for high power reactors (over 1000 {MWe}). The current analysis methodology yields heat flux values that are well above the cooling limit, but is based on correlations and strong hypotheses whose validity is subject to questions. This study investigates the potential of {CFD} codes to study the metallic layer as a complement to integral codes and experimental studies. A limited code assessment was performed on the water-based {BALI}-Métal experiments as well as low-Prandtl natural convection cases. A benchmark between two {CFD} codes was then carried out on prototypical computations; finally, a benchmark between {CFD} and integral codes was performed to assess the differences. The results of the code assessments are presented; they are in good agreement with the reference data on both the water-based and the low-Prandtl cases. The {CFD} benchmark on prototypical computations shows good convergence between the two codes, and a behavior that is markedly different from water experiments. The first results of the {CFD}/integral code benchmark are also presented. Finally, perspectives for future investigations are exposed.},

	abstract = {The paper presents simulations of a Station Blackout accident in a large generic {PWR} reactor with Ex-Vessel Melt Retention ({EVMR}) strategy. The nuclear power plant is equipped with core melt stabilisation device (core-catcher), which plays an essential role in its severe accident mitigation strategy. The plant model and simulations were prepared with the {MELCOR} 2.2.9541 computer code for in-vessel and ex-vessel phases. The analysis covered thermal-hydraulics, core degradation, {MCCI} and containment response. Conclusions were found about the core catcher modelling with {MELCOR}. It was found that the current {LHC} model cannot be directly used to assess the core catcher performance for the studied design. The mixed corium was studied for old and new ({SOARCA} based) {MELCOR} default setup and four parametric cases. It was observed that the corium conductivity multipliers have an impact on the assessment of the core catcher and containment response.},
