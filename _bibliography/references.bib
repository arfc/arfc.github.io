	abstract = {No operating molten salt reactors (MSRs) exist, so we must rely on computer simulations to study this technology. Popular MSR designs to use in simulations include the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR), the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). A key process to consider for MSRs is on-line fuel reprocessing and its effect on reactor dynamics. SaltProc is an open source interface code tool that simulates on-line fuel reprocessing when coupled with a depletion-capable transport solver. SaltProc was intended to be usable with any depletion solver, but initially was written with support for Serpent2 exclusively. In this work, the SaltProc codebase was overhauled to simplify coupling to depletion solvers. Support for OpenMC was also added. To ensure that the code maintained existing functionality as well as extended it, the new functionality was validated on a full-core model of the MSBR. The results indicate that keff between OpenMC and Serpent2 differ by +35 pcm at beginning of life and by 700 pcm at the end of the simulation after one year of operation. Additionally, the relative difference of most actinides is less than 2\%. The actinides with smaller concentrations in the fuel tend to have larger relative differences between the two codes. The results for fission products are similar, however, the relative differences are smaller, with most of the fission products having a relative difference no greater than 0.6\%. There are some outliers in the results with very high relative errors, however, these can be attributed to numerical errors. This is significant as this makes SaltProc the first completely open-source tool to flexibly and accurately simulate on-line fuel reprocessing.},

	abstract = {Current radioisotope identification devices struggle to identify and quantify isotopes in low-resolution gamma-ray spectra in a wide range of realistic conditions. Trained gamma-ray spectroscopists typically rely on intuition when identifying isotopes in spectra. A trained gamma-ray spectroscopist can inject their intuition into pattern recognition algorithms by creating training datasets and intelligently choosing a machine learning model for a task. Algorithms based on feature extraction such as peak finding or ROI algorithms work well for well-calibrated high resolution detectors. For low-resolution detectors, it may be more beneficial to use algorithms that incorporate more abstract features of the spectrum. To investigate this, we simulated datasets and used them to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) for identification and quantification tasks using gamma-ray spectra. Because the datasets were simulated, this method can be extended to a variety of gamma-ray spectroscopy tasks. Models weinvestigated include dense, convolutional, and autoencoder ANNs. In this work we introduce annsa, an open source Python package capable of creating gamma-ray spectroscopy training datasets and applying machine learning models to solve spectroscopic tasks. Using annsa, we found that identification performance in simulated spectra was sensitive to the source-to-background ratio, detector gain setting, and shielding. Performance was less sensitive to the source-detector height and detector resolution. We demonstrate annsa’s capabilities on a source inter-
diction classification problem, outperforming a peak-based Bayesian classifier for source identification. We also demonstrate annsa on a uranium enrich-
ment quantification problem which shows an accuracy useful for homeland security applications.},

	abstract = {In many fuel cycle simulators, the user must define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid supply chain gaps. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand-responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. Thus, a next-generation NFC simulator should predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. CYCLUS is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework [4]. In CYCLUS, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is an agent. Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution and facility agents can be grouped into. Institution agents control the deployment and decommission of facility agents and represents legal operating organizations such as a utility, government, etc. Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. CYCAMORE provides agents to represent process physics of various components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor). The Demand-Driven CYCAMORE Archetypes project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop CYCLUS’ demand-driven deployment capabilities. This capability is added as a CYCLUS Institution agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. This demand-driven deployment capability is called d3ploy. In this paper, we explain the capabilities of d3ploy and demonstrate how d3ploy minimizes undersupply of all commodities in a few simulations while meeting key simulation constraints. Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand transition scenarios are demonstrated. Insights are discussed to inform parameter input decisions for future work in setting up larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. And finally, the more complex transition scenarios are demonstrated.},

	copyright = {Copyright 2019 Greg Westphal},
	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the US, used nuclear fuel (UNF)
steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in
which reprocessing reduces build up of UNF. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this
transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor (LWR) and metallic fuels,
and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar to safety-by-design in next-generation
reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguardsby-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived
through modeling and simulation.
This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety
of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class
capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material
production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and
current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections
and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.
These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current US fuel cycle to a
sodium fast reactor (SFR) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined
through sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between
the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for (MUF). This work also
expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel
cycle fidelity.},

	abstract = {The University of California, Berkeley (UCB), has developed a preconceptual design for a commercial pebble-bed (PB), fluoride salt–cooled, high-temperature reactor (FHR) (PB-FHR). The baseline design for this Mark-I PB-FHR (Mk1) plant is a 236-MW(thermal) reactor. The Mk1 uses a fluoride salt coolant with solid, coated-particle pebble fuel. The Mk1 design differs from earlier FHR designs because it uses a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle designed to produce 100 MW(electric) of base-load electricity using a modified General Electric 7FB gas turbine. For peak electricity generation, the Mk1 has the ability to boost power output up to 242 MW(electric) using natural gas co-firing. The Mk1 uses direct heating of the power conversion fluid (air) with the primary coolant salt rather than using an intermediate coolant loop. By combining results from computational neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and pebble dynamics, UCB has developed a detailed design of the annular core and other key functional features. Both an active normal shutdown cooling system and a passive, natural-circulation-driven emergency decay heat removal system are included. Computational models of the FHR-validated using experimental data from the literature and from scaled thermal-hydraulic facilities-have led to a set of design criteria and system requirements for the Mk1 to operate safely and reliably. Three-dimensional, computer-aided-design models derived from the Mk1 design criteria are presented.},

Here, we report a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical study of a liquid-solid-like phase transition which takes place in a vertically vibrated fluidized granular monolayer. The first experimental setup is a long, narrow channel, with a width of the order of a few particle diameters, hence the dynamics is quasi-one-dimensional. We have considered this configuration to characterize the dynamic behavior of the phase transition. The second setup is used to measure the pressure as function of particle density in order to clarify the physical mechanism behind this phase transition. We demonstrate that the transition is mediated by waves and that it is triggered by a negative compressibility as in van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. Finally, in order to further characterize this phase transition, we study static and dynamic correlation functions, and bond-orientational order parameters.},

It can be a component of the academic research methods used to produce research results, or it may itself be an academic research result. Software, however, has rarely been considered to be a citable artifact in its own right. With the advent of open-source software, artifact evaluation committees of conferences, and journals that include source code and running systems as part of the published artifacts, we foresee that software will increasingly be recognized as part of the academic process. The quality and sustainability of this software must be accounted for, both a priori and a posteriori.

The Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop on “Engineering Academic Software” has examined the strengths, weaknesses, risks, and opportunities of academic software engineering. A key outcome of the workshop is this Dagstuhl Manifesto, serving as a roadmap towards future professional software engineering for software-based research instruments and other software produced and used in an academic context. The manifesto is expressed in terms of a series of actionable “pledges” that users and developers of academic research software can take as concrete steps towards improving the environment in which that software is produced.},

	abstract = {This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization NumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative (OSI).},

Current work introduces an extension of the MOOSE framework, Moltres, to appropriately model coupled thermal-hydraulics and neutronics of promising molten-salt-fueled reactor designs. Additionally, we have developed an online reprocessing simulation tool, SaltProc which includes fission product removal, fissile material separations, and refuelling for time dependent analysis of fuel-salt evolution. Initial simulations of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and the conceptual Molten Salt Breeder Reactor have been conducted on Blue Waters with deterministic multiphysics and Monte Carlo methods respectively. Steady state, transient, and fuel cycle analysis simulations have been run in 2D as well as 3D and compared against the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Fuel cycle dynamics and quasi-equilibrium compositions were obtained from depletion and reprocessing simulations for a 20-year time frame. The MSBR full-core safety analysis was performed at the startup and equilibrium fuel salt compositions, for important reactor safety parameters. In this work, conducted on Blue Waters, ARFC has demonstrated the capability to model complex physics in an advanced molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactor.},

PyRK is intended for analysis of many commonly studied transient scenarios including normal reactor startup and shutdown as well as abnormal scenarios including Beyond Design Basis Events (BDBEs) such as Accident Transients Without Scram (ATWS). For robustness, this package employs various tools within the scientific python ecosystem. For additional ease of use, it employs a reactor-agnostic, object-oriented data model, allowing nuclear engineers to rapidly prototype nuclear reactor control and safety systems in the context of their novel nuclear reactor designs.},

Verification studies compare various fuel cycle analysis tools to test agreement and identify sources of difference. A recent verification study, Feng et al.

This work verifies the performance of Cyclus, the agent-based, open-source fuel cycle simulator, using the test case specifications in Feng et. al. In this work, Cyclus demonstrates agreement with the results from the previous verification study. Minor differences reflect intentional, detailed material tracking in the Cycamore reactor module. These results extend the example results in Feng et al. to further enable future verification of additional nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools.},

A Cyclus simulation captured nuclear power deployment in the EU from 1970 to 2160. In this simulation, France begins its planned transition to SFRs as existing LWRs are decommissioned. These SFRs are fueled with UNF accumulated by other EU nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and SFR breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional LWRs by accepting UNF from other EU nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants (NPPs) produce significant quantities of waste heat due to the low thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. This waste heat carries roughly two-thirds of the total power generated at a nuclear power plant. It is responsibly released to the environment as a warm water flow, carrying with it a massive amount of low-grade thermal energy. As of now, this energy is lost from all Exelon NPPs. This waste heat is essentially a free source of energy and utilization projects offer the potential to significantly increase the thermal efficiency and profitability of centralized power generating stations, in particular NPPs.
Agricultural projects, particularly climate-controlled greenhouses, may show the most dramatic benefit from waste-heat utilization. Due to the relatively low temperature requirements of greenhouses, heating costs may be eliminated or cut substantially by the implementation of waste heat. The technical readiness of coupling central power generation station’s waste heat discharge to climate-controlled greenhouses is high and has been demonstrated. Implementing this combined heat and power approach to Exelon’s fleet of NPPs could offer significant advantages over fossil fueled power plants due to their high capacity factor, and strictly controlled and monitored water discharge.   
Exelon NPPs at Braidwood, Byron, Dresden, and Calvert Cliffs hold potential to supply significant agricultural waste heat. Few regulations exist specific to the use of waste heat from NPPs, but the discharge of waste heat from NPPs is strictly regulated, mitigating potential for regulatory hurdles to its use in other industries. Waste heat from Exelon’s NPPs is an untapped and potentially lucrative commodity. In the Midwest, the location of Exelon’s NPPs offers interesting opportunities for waste heat use in agriculture. The cold Midwest climate is normally a limiting factor in crop diversity and heated greenhouses are an option for overcoming this issue, but the heating costs are a barrier themselves. With cooperation between growers and the Exelon Corporation, waste heat may be commoditized while also facilitating more efficient and diverse growing operations. Waste heat use is not limited to farming operations. There are a host of industries that can benefit from waste heat use that may be local to other power plants. The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located ideally to facilitate the farming of oysters with waste heat or even provide heat for liquefied natural gas vaporization. 
This report details a preliminary analysis to evaluate the potential for utilizing waste heat from NPPs. From the exhaustive review of past waste heat efforts, agricultural options, and primary economic and radiological factors, the technical readiness is shown to be high and the concept is sound. It is recommended that a detailed analysis should follow that includes: coupling candidate NPPs to specific greenhouse architectures, exploration of high-value crop options in prototypic and bounding event environments, and a detailed economic assessment.},

To address this gap in capability of fuel cycle simulators, the Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project (NEUP-FY16-10512) is developing prediction algorithms to give Cyclus demand-driven deployment capabilities. This means that Cyclus will have the capability to deploy sup- porting fuel cycle facilities to meet front-end and back-end demands of the fuel cycle.

This paper will discuss the numerical experiments required to test the various prediction algorithms designed for the project.

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in advanced reactors and the following need for techno-economic transitions has increased the demand for tools necessary to model complex nuclear fuel cycles (NFCs) and advanced reactor technologies. This thesis demonstrates the capability of CYCLUS , the agent-based fuel cycle simulator, to model, simulate, and analyze real-life fuel cycle transition scenarios. I introduce new methods and tools that use various databases to model and simulate real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios involving advanced reactor technologies.

The work in this thesis contains: (1) benchmarking Cyclus to other nuclear fuel cycle simulators (NFC simulators); (2) developing new methods and tools necessary for modeling and simulating real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios; (3) simulation of both domestic and international nuclear technology transitions.

The methods and tools developed for such capabilities include: (1) modeling and simulating past and current nuclear fleets using historic nuclear reactor operations database; (2) modeling individual reactors and their operating history to calculate nuclear material inventory; (3) modeling Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) behavior in a large-scale fuel cycle simulation.

Benchmark work shows that CYCLUS results coincide with results from other NFC simulators with minor differences due to modeling choices. Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the CYCLUS capability to effectively model and simulate real-life NFC transition scenarios that involve advanced reactor technologies such as MSRs.},

In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy.

In 2015, the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Ac- tion Plan (iCAP) [5]. This plan identified nuclear energy as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we use the RAVEN framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the UIUC embedded grid. The greatest source economic variability is contained in the capital costs of a micro-reactor. Thus we examine both scenarios where the reactor is provided at no cost to the university and purchased at full price.},

Costs drive the equation, but policies affecting electricity pricing also influence nuclear power revenues at a fundamental level. In current reactors and their associated fuel cycles, capital, operation, and maintenance costs increasingly dominate the economics of nuclear power.
Advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle choices can impact these costs both positively
and negatively. While fuel cycle advancements also impact fuel costs, this component has a relatively small impact on the overall cost of nuclear electricity production, particularly in comparison to capital costs. If advanced reactors can offer very high-temperature heat appropriate for industrial processing, natively couple with storage technologies, or can otherwise acheive load following behavior, then they may become more financially feasible than the current fleet.},

Given the abundance of WH from NPPs and the ubiquity of generally low-grade heat requirements of agricultural operations, from production to post-harvest, there is remarkable potential to harness NPP WH for agricultural uses with mutual economic advantages to NPPs and agricultural sectors. Taking advantage of this WH resource may improve the financial outlook of both the partnered power plants and agricultural businesses by providing an additional revenue stream, decreased heating costs, and a reduced carbon footprint. This review summarizes and interprets the historical discourse and research on agricultural applications of NPP WH in the U.S., and synthesizes technical constraints, unknowns, and opportunities for realizing the benefits of WH derived from the nuclear energy sector for agricultural value chains. Previous applications of WH in the agricultural industry demonstrate that this is a viable option to the benefit of the parties involved under the right conditions, but relatively little has been done to further this technology in the U.S. in recent years or explore novel applications. A revival of interest in this technology may be warranted given the current outlook for NPPs in the U.S. and a general interest in reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.},

Prior development work has utilized tech- niques such as system dynamics to provide a solution structure for the matching of supply and demand in these simulations. In general, however, simulation infrastructure development has occured in relatively closed circles, each effort having unique considerations as to the cases which are desired to be modeled. Accordingly, individual simulators tend to have their design decisions driven by specific use cases. Presented in this work is a proposed supply and demand matching algorithm that lever- ages the techniques of the well-studied field of mathematical programming. A generic approach is achieved by treating fa- cilities as individual entities and actors in the supply-demand market which denote preferences amongst commodities. Using such a framework allows for varying levels of interaction fi- delity, ranging from low-fidelity, quick solutions to high-fidelity solutions that model individual transactions (e.g. at the fuel- assembly level). The power of the technique is that it allows such flexibility while still treating the problem in a generic man- ner, encapsulating simulation engine design decisions in such a way that future simulation requirements can be relatively easily added when needed.},

	abstract = {Liquid-fueled Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) systems represent advances in safety, economics, and sustainability. The MSR has been designed to operate with a Th/233U fuel cycle with 233U used as startup fissile material. Since 233U does not exist in nature, we must examine other available fissile materials to start up these reactor concepts. This work investigates the fuel cycle and neutronics performance of the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR) with different fissile material loadings at startup: High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) (19.79\%), Pu mixed with HALEU (19.79\%), reactor-grade Pu (a mixture of Pu isotopes chemically extracted from Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) spent nuclear fuel (SNF) with 33 GWd/tHM burnup), transuranic elements (TRU) from Light Water Reactor (LWR) SNF, and 233U. The MSR burnup routine provided by SERPENT-2 is used to simulate the online reprocessing and refueling in the SD-TMSR. The effective multiplication factor, fuel salt composition evolution, and net production of 233U are studied in the present work. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation is calculated. The results show that the continuous flow of reactor-grade Pu helps transition to the thorium fuel cycle within a relatively short time (≈4.5 years) compared to 26 years for 233U startup fuel. Finally, using TRU as the initial fuel materials offers the possibility of operating the SD-TMSR for an extended period of time (≈40 years) without any external feed of 233U.},

These systems are often referred to as nuclear hy- brid energy systems (NHES) and are generally robust, reliable, economically appealing, and have low to zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1, 2, 3, 4]. In 2015, the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Ac- tion Plan (iCAP) [5]. This plan identified nuclear energy as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we use the RAVEN framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the UIUC embedded grid. The greatest source economic variability is contained in the capital costs of a micro-reactor. Thus we examine both scenarios where the reactor is provided at no cost to the university and purchased at full price.},

The MSFR can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the MSFR using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with SERPENT and published MSFR results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the ULOHS scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing MSFR simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an MSFR loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

paradigm follows the transacation of discrete quanta of ma-
terial among discrete facilities, arranged in a geographic and
institutional framework, and trading in flexible markets. Key
concepts in the design of C YCLUS include open access to the
simulation engine, modularity with regard to functionality, and
relevance to both scientific and policy analyses. The combina-
tion of modular encapsulation within the software architec-
ture and an open development paradigm allows for a bal-
ance between collaboration at multiple levels of simulation
detail and security of proprietary or sensitive data.
When comparing different nuclear fuel cycle concepts, it
can be a challenge to find any two systems analyses that com-
pare across a common set of metrics with a similar set of un-
derlying assumptions. Each analysis is likely to focus on a set
of metrics that are of interest to the team performing the analy-
sis and involve both implicit and explicit assumptions and con-
straints about the behavior of the fuel cycle system. While
a strict prescription of these metrics, assumptions and con-
straints could be proposed for comparison purposes, another
solution is to provide a systems analysis simulation tool that
provides sufficient modularity, extensibility and open access,
that it can be a basis for harmonzing to a common set. If it
becomes easier to modify an existing simulation tool to sup-
port the needs of a new analysis than it is to develop a new
tool, then it is possible that such a tool will be adopted more
universally for such analysis.},

	abstract = {The theory of non-ideal gases at thermodynamic equilibrium, for instance the van der Waals gas model, has played a central role in our
understanding of coexisting phases, as well as the transitions between them. In contrast, the theory fails with granular matter because
collisions between the grains dissipate energy, and their macroscopic size renders thermal fluctuations negligible. When a mass of
grains is subjected to mechanical vibration, it can make a transition to a fluid state. In this state, granular matter exhibits patterns and
instabilities that resemble those of molecular fluids. Here, we report a granular solid–liquid phase transition in a vibrating granular
monolayer. Unexpectedly, the transition is mediated by waves and is triggered by a negative compressibility, as for van der Waals
phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. The dynamic behaviour
that we observe—coalescence, coagulation and wave propagation—is common to a wide class of phase transitions. We have combined
experimental, numerical and theoretical studies to build a theoretical framework for this transition.},

The analysis focuses on the four key sectors of storage, supplementing the gas grid, power generation, and transportation, detailing the potential range of hydrogen technologies which are expected to penetrate Japanese energy markets up to 2050 and beyond. Alongside key model outcomes, the appropriate policy settings, governance and market mechanisms are described which underpin the potential hydrogen economy future for Japan. We find that transportation, gas grid supplementation, and storage end-uses may emerge in significant quantities due to policies which encourage ambitious implementation targets, investment in technologies and research and development, and the emergence of a future carbon pricing regime. On the other hand, for Japan which will initially be dependent on imported hydrogen, the cost of imports appears critical to the emergence of broad hydrogen usage, particularly in the power generation sector. Further, the consideration of demographics in Japan, recognizing the aging, shrinking population and peoples\&rsquo; energy use preferences will likely be instrumental in realizing a smooth transition toward a hydrogen economy.},

The active core of the SD-TMSR is divided into the inner zone (486 fuel tubes) and the outer zone (522 fuel tubes) to improve the Th-U3 breeding performance. This work adopted the SERPENT-2 Monte Carlo code to analyze the whole core model of the SD-TMSR. Built-in SERPENT-2 capabilities simulated online reprocessing and refueling and calculated the multiplication factor and Breeding Ratio (BR). We found that the molten salt Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity (αT) was negative for initial and equilibrium states. This study investigated the variation of the multiplication factor, BR, and build-up of important nuclides in the core as a function of burnup. Under online reprocessing and refueling, we studied the variation of the reactivity during 60 years of reactor operation. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation was calculated. Finally, these simulations determined the appropriate 232Th and 233U feed rates for maintaining criticality and enabled analysis of the overall SD-TMSR fuel cycle performance.},

The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

	abstract = {Localizing a radiation source in an urban environment is a challenge in nuclear nonproliferation
and radiation detection. One approach to localize a source is to send a mobile radiation sensor
network into an area of interest to collect count rate measurements at many locations in an
attempt to find the radiation source. However, there are numerous temporal and spatial factors
that cause changes in background count rate measurements, and these factors make it challenging
to analyze the collected data. Displaying these measurements in a virtual environment has
contextualized them and helps a user determine if environmental factors are introducing false
positives. A virtual model has been shown to visualize collected measurements in near real-time,
but not in real-time. The ability for a user to quickly address alarm measurements is hampered
by this lack of real-time data access as well as due to poor quality virtual models.
Another challenge in radiation detection is sampling an environment to assess the status of an
area following a radiological or nuclear incident. Following an incident, environmental samples
must be collected and analyzed to identify the radioactive substances present and assess the
environmental damages. Incident response must be rapid and the sample collection must occur
without error. A software named Visual Sample Plan (VSP) has been developed by Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to help guide the sample collection process and
statistically inform decisions. This thesis begins with an overview of the radiation source search
and environmental sampling problems and how they have been addressed. Next, earlier work that
has attempted to address each of these problems and the motivation for these responses is
discussed. Finally, new work extending the prior solutions is discussed. To address the radiation
source search problem, a method to create higher quality 3D models is explored, and an alternate
method to store and retrieve data in the cloud using DynamoDB is implemented. By
implementing VSP in Augmented Reality (AR), opportunities for error are further limited. This
thesis concludes with suggestions for future work to approach robust solutions to each problem.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. Current MSR modeling efforts in the literature usually assume ideal (e.g., 100\% of neutron poison being removed) rather than realistically constrained removal efficiency. This work proposes to create a Python package, SaltProc, which will implement realistically constrained extraction efficiency of fission product based on physical models of fuel processing components appearing in various MSR systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of SaltProc, the Transatomic Power (TAP) concept will be simulated to capture the evolution of fuel salt composition during reactor operation with a realistic, physics-driven model of an online fuel reprocessing system. SaltProc will also be applied to determine the feasibility and safety of load following for the TAP system. This proposal outlines extensions to this work, including investigating safety parameters (temperature coefficients, shutdown margin, axial power offset) evolution over a 60-year reactor operation lifetime and during short-term load-following transients.},

The JOSS review process is modeled on the established approach of the rOpenSci collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on GitHub; articles not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance—unlike other journals, articles requiring major revision are not rejected.

	abstract = {Many nuclear power plants are at risk of shutting down due to a combination of policy decisions and financial strain [1]. Accurately predicting the generation from solar and wind may help minimize profit losses for nuclear power plants. Nu- clear power competes with natural gas to fulfill the net demand after accounting for renewable energy sources. Load following gives natural gas an economic edge over nuclear power be- cause natural gas plants can follow grid demand and even shut off when renewable penetration makes the price of electricity go negative [2]. It is possible for existing nuclear plants to load follow somewhat and some French nuclear plants have been retrofitted to follow daily variations in electricity demand [3]. As penetration of solar and wind energy increases around the world, load following will depend less on electric demand pro- files and more on renewable energy profiles. This shift makes load following with current nuclear power plants intractable [4]. Renewable energy challenges the base load electricity production that nuclear provides in the United States by in- troducing grid demand variability. Advanced reactor designs, like some Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), promise strong load following capabilities due to active 135Xe removal [5]. Unfor- tunately, the most mature MSR designs are at least a decade away from obtaining a commercial license in the United States. The climate crisis is too urgent to wait this long for nuclear power to become fully competitive with natural gas [6].
Variability has been the primary drawback for renewable energy sources like wind turbines, solar PV, and solar concen- trators, since their inception. This flaw worsens as renewable energy penetration increases [4]. Forecasting electricity pro- duction from renewable sources is therefore important for successful management of power systems [7]. Recent studies applied artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically multi- layer perceptrons, to the task of net load forecasting [7, 8, 9]. These studies made short term forecasts of 4-6 hours but nu- clear plants need accurate forecasts further ahead to facilitate load following. This study will be the first to apply Echo State Networks (ESNs) to the task of net load prediction.},

	url = {https://books.google.com/books/about/GLOBAL_2017.html?id=1UjsuQEACAAJ},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, NFC simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a NFC simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current NFC simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},

	doi = {10.21105/joss.00298},
	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
(MSRs) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using MPI which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and MOOSE allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
MOOSE provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(Kópházi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to estimate depleted PWR fuel assembly compositions is used to model scenarios in which the PWR fuel burnup and enrichment vary over time. The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) Unified Database (UDB) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. UNF inventory profile predicted by the model with the UDB UNF inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for UNF inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope GENeration (ORIGEN) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity PWR depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to NFC simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a dataset from a complex fuel depletion model can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.},

- Nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste disposal decisions are technologically coupled through the characteristics of spent fuel which vary among fuel cycles and impact repository design and performance
- Dynamic integration of generic disposal model with fuel cycle systems analysis framework is necessary to illuminate performance distinctions of candidate repository host media, designs, and engineering components in the context of fuel cycle options
- Most current tools treat waste disposal phase of fuel cycle analysis statically in post processing by reporting values such as mass, volumes, radiotoxicity, or heat production of accumulated SNF and high level waste. They fail to address the dynamic impact of the waste streams on the performance of the geologic disposal system.

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1–3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

The primary purpose of JOSS is to enable developers of research software to receive citation credit equivalent to typical archival publications. JOSS papers are deliberately extremely short, and are required to include a short abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, authors and their affiliations, and key references, as well as link to an archived version of the software (e.g., DOI obtained from Zenodo). Upon acceptance, papers receive a CrossRef DOI. Rather than a review of a lengthy software paper (including, e.g., methodology, validation, sample results), JOSS submissions undergo rigorous peer review of both the abstract and software itself, including documentation, tests, continuous integration, and licensing. The JOSS review process is modeled on the established approach of the rOpenSci collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on GitHub; papers not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance---unlike other journals, papers requiring major revision are not rejected. Since its public release in May 2016, JOSS has published 26 accepted papers as of September 2016, with an additional 20 submitted and under review.},

Simultaneous with this widening gap in hands-on training, unprecedented federal funding to demonstrate and commercialize advanced reactors has been distributed to companies promising a bright future for advanced nuclear energy. But, in this future, who will objectively test these reactors, train their operators, educate their reactor engineers, and improve the technology through innovative experiments?

In this talk, I'll suggest that universities remain poised to play many of these roles in the future of next-generation nuclear reactor deployment and university campuses are uniquely suited for early deployments. We at UIUC envision a next-generation university test, research, and training reactor that could underpin advanced reactor commercialization toward national leadership in a clean, sustainable energy future. Our vision for the deployment of a next-generation university TRTR aims to amplify the profound expertise at campuses in research, education, and power production to address the urgent need for advanced reactor prototype testing as well as next-generation research toward integration with carbon-free energy technologies. I will describe a vision of the future in which universities and their research can and must play a significant role in prototype testing next-generation reactors, support commercial licensing and deployment, conduct operations research, drive innovations in associated technologies, and train a next-generation workforce to operate and maintain these next-generation devices.},

The current work introduces a reliable safety system based on control rods in addition to the online feed system reactivity control in the Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR). Three different initial fissile loadings are considered: 233U, reactor-grade Pu, and transuranic (TRU) elements as a startup fuel. We applied six different absorbing materials to investigate the main operational and safety parameters in the SD-TMSR: natural B4C, enriched B4C with 90\% 10B, HfB2, HfH1.62, Eu2O3, and Gd2O3. The present work focuses on control rod design, integral and differential control rod worth, shutdown margin, and shadowing effects at steady-state. We employed the SERPENT-2 Monte-Carlo code to calculate the reactivity worth and analyze the performance of the reactivity control system. We showed that 233U and reactor-grade Pu startup cores maintain adequate shutdown margin with all considered absorbers. Finally, this paper proposes a design of control rod clusters that compensate the excess reactivity of the SD-TMSR loaded with different initial fissile material.},

	abstract = {In an effort to curb carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change, energy policymakers are considering advanced nuclear reactors as a potential source of clean base-load energy. Once such family of reactor designs is called the Molten Salt Reactor, which has been successfully demonstrated experimentally during the operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment(MSRE) at the Oak-Ridge National Laboratory during the 1960s. Thermal-hydraulic simulations of this reactor are an important step towards validating and verifying simulation tools for other molten salt reactor designs and exploring the potential of such reactors for licensing. Modern CFD simulations of the MSRE reactor core often discount the effects of turbulence in this reactor due to the low Reynolds number inside the MSRE channels. They also neglect the pyramidal tip at the top of the moderator graphite blocks called stringers. However, recent research indicates turbulence can play a significant role in compact reactor cores at relatively low Reynolds numbers. Our main concern is entrainment of fuel salt in recirculation zones and subsequent creation of localised hotspots. Therefore, we investigated the presence of such recirculation zones and the effect of the tip-shape on turbulence and stationary vortices in the upper plenum.
We analysed the flow around an MSRE graphite stringer using large eddy simulations performed in Nek5000. We also studied the effects of varying the size and shape of the stringer-tip using Nek5000’s mesh deformation capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first effort to apply large eddy simulations to the MSRE and study the effects of geometry-induced turbulence and recirculation within the MSRE. We analysed the output data and found that salt recirculation vortices do exist and geometry and turbulence affect the salt flow in the upper plenum. But fuel salt recirculation does not impact the temperature of the salt or graphite significantly. We also determined the ideal tip-shape that minimises salt recirculation and entrapment. We found that a pyramidal tip with an apex half-angle of 45◦ disrupts recirculation, encourages mixing, and improves heat transfer, keeping salt and graphite temperatures low, whereas angles that are as small as 30◦ or large enough to tend towards a flat-top lead to hotter temperatures. Implications for the design and simulation of similar channel-type molten salt reactors are discussed.},

In particular, the February 2021 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus report, “Accelerating Decarbonization of the U.S. Energy System,” determined unequivocally that US decarbonization will require keeping existing nuclear plants open [2]. Consistent with that liter- ature, our simulations indicate that decarbonization in Illinois will require not only maintenance but expansion of nuclear energy capacity.},

To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy. User-controlled capabilities such as supply/ capacity buffers, constraint deployment, prediction algorithms, and installed capacity deployment were introduced in d3ploy to give a user the tools to minimize commodity undersupply in a simulation. We demonstrate d3ploy’s capability to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet various types of user-defined power demands: constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal.},

Benchmark phases I-A and I-B involve reactor physics analysis of a representative fuel element, without and with depletion. Several configurations are considered (e.g., unrodded and rodded configuration, presence of burnable absorbers, variable enrichment). Parameters compared include multiplication factor, reactivity coefficients, flux distribution, neutron spectrum and isotopic composition change with burnup. Seven organizations from four countries are taking part in this blind-benchmark exercise, using Monte Carlo and deterministic methods. Given the complex combination of materials and geometry, the FHR benchmark is expected to be challenging, particularly for deterministic codes. As the nuclear data libraries underpinning both deterministic and Monte Carlo methods have had limited testing for FHR systems, and molten salt systems in general, the benchmark aims to provide feedback to both the nuclear data community as well as molten salt reactor designers with regards to the variance of results with different nuclear data sources. This paper reports on the current results submitted and provides comparisons and analysis. Overall, the observed agreement is satisfactory, although notable differences are identified in specific cases, suggesting need for further in-depth analysis of those cases.},

This work explored parameters of interest including the number of advanced reactors deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, and the Separative Work Unit capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the reactors. Deploying Micro Modular Reactors requires a higher average mass and Separative Work Unit capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, and a lower enriched uranium mass and a higher Separative Work Unity capacity than required to fuel Light Water Reactors before the transition.

that promise signi cant advances in safety, sustainability, e ciency, and cost over existing
designs. The Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor (FHR) system, speci cally
the Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) design, combines the best aspects of two

VHTR's high-temperature coated-particle fuel. The AHTR's fuel geometry has triple het-

further understand and address the technical challenges associated with the AHTR de-
sign, this work proposes participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development-Nuclear Energy Agency's FHR benchmarking exercise by modeling its neutron-

straight fuel channels or homogenous fuel enrichment, and optimize for arbitrary geometries

	abstract = {The present United States nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identi ed four classes of nuclear fuel cycle options the U.S could transition to, which would overcome these challenges and make nuclear energy technology more desirable. The transitions have been modeled by various nuclear fuel cycle simulators. However, most fuel cycle simulators require the user to define a deployment
scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid any supply chain gaps, which becomes tedious for complex transition scenarios. This thesis developed a capability in Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle
simulator, to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This new capability successfully deployed fuel cycle facilities in a transition scenario from the current light water reactor fleet to a closed fuel cycle with continuous recycling of transuranics in fast and thermal reactors. In reality, these transition scenarios inevitably diverge from the modeled scenario. This work coupled the nuclear fuel cycle simulator tools, Cyclus and DYMOND, with Dakota, a
sensitivity analysis toolkit. This work conducted one-at-a-time, synergistic, and global sensitivity analysis with Cyclus-Dakota and DYMOND-Dakota, to understand the interdependence of input
parameters on the transition performance from the current light water reactor 
eet to a closed fuel cycle in which transuranics are recycled to fuel mixed oxide fuel thermal reactors and sodium fast-cooled reactors. The global sensitivity analysis concluded that the transition year input parameter was the most influential to the final depleted uranium and total idle reactor capacity performance
metrics, and the fleet share ratio and cooling time input parameters were the most influential to the final high level waste amount in the simulation. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis showed
that varying transition year from 80 to 84 years increased the final depleted uranium amount by 1.13\% and reduced the total idle reactor capacity by 10.36\%. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis also showed that varying fleet share ratio (mixed oxide fuel light water reactor: sodium fast-cooled reactor) from 0:100 to 20:80 reduced the final high level waste amount by 2\%, and varying the used fuel cooling time from 0 to 8 years reduced the final high level waste amount by 4\%. Therefore, an optimized transition scenario that minimizes final high level waste amount, final depleted uranium amount, and total idle capacity must have a fleet share ratio of 20:80, used fuel cooling time of 8
years, and a transition year at 83 years. This work compared Cyclus-Dakota's and DYMOND-Dakota's sensitivity analysis capabilities and concluded that automated deployment of supporting fuel cycle facilities is crucial for conducting sensitivity analyses with nuclear fuel cycle simulators, to ensure that the simulation adapts to the new parameters by minimizing idle reactor capacity.
The results demonstrated that time is saved if a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a nuclear fuel cycle transition scenario begins with a global sensitivity analysis study to gain a general overview of the influential input variables for the performance metrics. Then, based on the global sensitivity analysis results, a reduced number of one-at-a-time and synergistic sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine quantitative trends and impacts of influential input variables on the performance metrics.},

	copyright = {Copyright 2020 Roberto Fairhurst Agosta},
	abstract = {The future energy needs require the development of clean energy sources to ease the increasing environmental concerns. High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors have several desirable features that make them ideal candidates for the near-future large-scale deployment. Some of these features are a high temperature and high thermal cycle efficiency, which enable a wide range of process heat applications, such as hydrogen production. Implementing hydrogen economies can decarbonize the transport and power sectors, offering an alternative to ease climate change.
This work uses Moltres as the primary simulation tool. Although Moltres original development targeted Molten Salt Reactors, this work studies Moltres applicability to multi-physics simulations of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors. Multi-physics simulations are necessary for assessing reactor safety characteristics. Ensuring
Moltres’ multi-physics modeling capabilities requires assessing the independent modeling capabilities of the different physical phenomena. Therefore, this thesis breaks down the analysis into three parts: stand-alone neutronics, stand-alone thermal-fluids, and coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids.
Regarding stand-alone neutronics, several analyses compare the results calculated by Moltres and Serpent on an MHTGR-350 model. The first analysis studies the energy group structure effects on the simulation of a fuel column. The results of the study suggest using a 15-energy group structure for attaining a desirable accuracy. The following analysis focuses on the full-core problem and compares different aspects of the simulations, concluding that Moltres obtains reasonably accurate results. The final study on stand-alone neutronics describes Moltres results of Phase I Exercise 1 of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 Benchmark. The benchmark exercise proved to be a modeling challenge, requiring the implementation of several approximations. For the most part, this thesis demonstrates Moltres’ capability to simulate stand-alone neutronics of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors.
Regarding stand-alone thermal-fluids, several studies compare Moltres results to previously published results.
These studies focus on local models such as the unit cell and the fuel column problems, for which Moltres temperature results differ by less than 2\% from the published results. Further studies analyze the possibility of extending the thermal-fluids model implemented in the previous problems to a full-core simulation, finding a high memory
requirement imposed by the simulations. The full-core simulations focus on Phase I Exercise 2 of the benchmark, for which the implementation of a two-level approach in Moltres was necessary. The study’s temperatures were within an 11.3\% difference to the published results, concluding that further analysis is required.
Regarding coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids, the analysis describes Phase I Exercise 3 of the benchmark. The exercise uses a simplified model that helps visualize some of the essential aspects of multi-physics simulations in Moltres. This exercise finds some areas of improvement in Moltres’ model and sets a basis for future work.
This thesis aligns with the University of Illinois’ goals to reduce carbon emissions from its campus’s electricity generation and transportation sectors. This work focuses on two main analysis by introducing a nuclear reactor coupled to a hydrogen plant as a solution. The first analysis evaluates the conversion of the university fleet and the mass transit transport system in Urbana-Champaign to Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. The second analysis investigates the duck curve phenomenon in the university’s grid and introduces a mitigation strategy that may reduce the reliance on dispatchable sources. These studies emphasize how nuclear energy and hydrogen production can potentially mitigate climate change.},

The results show that Moltres performed comparably to participating software packages in the benchmark; the majority of the relevant quantities fell within one standard deviation of the benchmark average. Among the participating multiphysics tools in the benchmark, Moltres agrees closest to the multiphysics tool from the Delft University of Technology due to similarities in the numerical solution techniques and meshing schemes.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing of reactor core components removes the geometric constraints required by conventional manufacturing, such as slabs as fuel planks and cylinders as fuel rods. Due to the expansion of the potential design space facilitated through additive manufacturing, reactor designers need to find methods, such as generative design, to explore the design space efficiently. In this defense, I will show that I successfully applied evolutionary algorithms to conduct generative reactor design optimization for a fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR). I achieved this through three distinct research efforts: 1) furthering our understanding of the FHR design’s complexities through neutronics and temperature modeling, 2) creating an open-source tool that enables generative design reactor optimization with evolutionary algorithms, and 3) applying the tool to the FHR to optimize for non-conventional geometries and fuel distributions},

	abstract = {Decarbonizing the United States energy system is a challenging task. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of strong federal climate policy, leaving individual states and institutions to drive the energy sector towards net-zero carbon emissions. ESOM tools use linear programming to develop policy insights that may help achieve full decarbonization. However, there is a widely recognized tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost. Adding spatial, temporal, and technological details make these models more realistic, but may make them computationally intractable. Previously, most ESOM studies prioritize technology options over spatial or temporal detail. This choice emphasizes the role of technology costs, such as fuel and capital costs, on energy policy without considering operational challenges. This thesis uses the ESOM, Temoa to model Illinois’ and the University of Illinois’ energy systems and develops the PyGenesys tool to facilitate sensitivity analysis. The sensitivities considered in this work are temporal resolution and the annual capacity factors of wind and solar energy, or the inter-annual variability.

The results of the time resolution study showed that any temporal aggregation above an hourly level may generate misleading results that minimizes the roles of firm clean power and energy storage. Additionally, the role of wind energy is overestimated in models with less temporal detail, and the roles of solar energy and advanced nuclear reactors are underestimated. The study of inter-annual variability showed that energy systems with majority variable intermittent renewables, such as solar and wind, that exclude clean firm power from nuclear power plants exhibit higher energy costs with nearly 63 times the variance of systems that use a majority of clean firm power. Additionally, the amount of capacity necessary to meet electricity demand is greater and more uncertain in systems with high renewable penetration. Finally, based on the results in each of the sensitivity analyses, this thesis recommends that Illinois continues supporting its existing nuclear fleet with “zero emissions credits” and expand clean firm capacity with advanced nuclear reactors by lifting the moratorium on new nuclear builds.},

	abstract = {The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) within the Department of Energy (DOE) works to advance nuclear energy science and technology to meet U.S. energy, environmental, and economic needs. NE focuses on research and development (R\&D) that prioritizes the continued operation of the current fleet of nuclear reactors, building new reactors, securing and sustaining the nuclear fuel cycle, and expanding international nuclear cooperation.
The R\&D budget of NE supports nuclear science and technology missions by national laboratories, universities, and industry.
Stopping the premature closure of existing nuclear power plants due to economic reasons can save gigawatts of clean firm power on the grid.
Nuclear energy is the largest source of carbon-free energy in the United States. It accounts for 18 percent of all electricity generated and 47 percent of all carbon emissions-free electricity in the United States.
R\&D programs enhance the performance of nuclear energy plants, extend their lifetime, reduce operating costs, and develop advanced fuels.
Historically, conventional nuclear power plants run at single power, at baseload, and cannot vary their generation. However, advanced nuclear technology provides many opportunities for reactors to vary in power to complement renewable energy facilities. Advanced nuclear technology also provides thermal storage capabilities that allow reactors to stay at high temperatures while the amount of electricity they dispatch to the grid can vary.
Developing small modular reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors will offer siting flexibility, scalability, and energy uses beyond electricity. With less space required for emergency planning zones, SMRs can be more suitable for environments like repurposed retired and retiring fossil fuel plants.
NE is developing micro-reactors for off-grid communities and backup power, the kind of situations that diesel generators often address.
There are a number of communities and assets across the country that we cannot leave behind in the transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Nuclear reactors are especially suited to leveraging grid, workforce, and other assets at retiring or retired coal plant sites.
Repurposing unabated fossil plants could deliver place-based solutions to advance an equitable energy transition.
A recent DOE study shows that 80 percent of U.S. coal communities could benefit from replacing their coal plants with nuclear ones. Each community could gain 650 new permanent jobs, additional economic activity of \$275 million, and an 86 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Leveraging existing infrastructure would reduce total system costs.
The DOE has recently released reports on long-duration energy storage, clean hydrogen, and commercializing advanced nuclear.
To get to the net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal, the buildout of nuclear energy will need to be aggressive. Clean firm power will be necessary to support variable renewable energy.
To secure and sustain the global nuclear fuel cycle, conversion and enrichment capacity must be expanded, a strategy for integrated waste management of spent nuclear fuel must be developed, and consent-based approaches to siting interim storage facilities must be implemented.
A consent-based siting approach would consolidate the 70 locations across the country where communities are currently hosting spent nuclear fuel but never agreed to host it for the long term. The DOE was supposed to take title of this fuel in 1988.
This consent-based approach prioritizes people and communities; seeks willing and informed consent; is flexible, adaptive, and collaborative; is responsive to community concerns; centers equity and environmental justice; and is informed by public feedback.
NE supports R\&D cooperation across borders to ensure research focuses on peaceful uses of nuclear power as well as to ensure the ability of the United States to have a voice in global leadership on this topic.},

This work includes laying the groundwork for peaceful nuclear power to help the U.S. reach net-zero emissions by 2050, for securing and sustaining both the front and back ends of our nuclear fuel cycle and for expanding international nuclear energy cooperation. This talk will highlight the DOE NE mission, vision and programs contributing to these goals as well as the opportunities and challenges ahead. These challenges and opportunities include a need to mobilize bold private capital investments, scale-up a skilled workforce, revive and invent critical supply chains and underpin it all with processes and policies that consider equity and justice.},

We implemented the approach into a hypothetical channel of molten salt reactors to demonstrate the applicability of the method. We prepared a Python tool, named Plankton, which couples to a reactor physics code and an optimization tool, and imports ML methods. The tool performs three consecutive phases: reactor database generation, machine learning application, and design optimization. We identified the extra trees method as the best performing estimator. With the estimator, we found nine optimum designs in total, one for each fuel-salt pair, and estimated all the performance metrics of the designs with a {\textless}5\% prediction error compared to their actual values. U-Pu-NaCl fuel-salt gave promising results with the highest conversion ratio, the most negative feedback coefficient, and the lowest fast flux.},

Critically, our simulations incorporate novel technologies like hydrogen electrolysers, carbon capture, photochemical water splitting, and emerging photovoltaic cells, assess long-term impacts up to the year 2100, and include life-cycle emissions and learning curves for parameters such as investment cost, efficiency, and emission coefficients. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, using nuclear power and hydrogen from renewable energy-based electrolysis, is cost-effective and provides long-term emission reduction along with energy security. Nuclear, wind, solar, and hydrogen from renewables emerge as key emission reduction technologies, while natural gas with carbon capture plays a minor role in achieving emission reduction targets.},

Our study highlights the influence of cultural background in the US, alongside educational achievement and income level on perceptions toward the energy system and energy policy. Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational achievement. For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural grouping. Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and energy system factors compared to their peers. Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment, and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition justice outcomes.},

	abstract = {Science gateways are a crucial component of critical infrastructure as they provide the means for users to focus on their topics and methods instead of the technical details of the infrastructure. They are defined as end-to-end solutions for accessing data, software, computing services, sensors, and equipment specific to the needs of a science or engineering discipline and their goal is to hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. Science gateways are often called Virtual Research Environments in Europe and Virtual Labs in Australasia; we consider these two terms to be synonymous with science gateways. Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have found applications in many different fields in private industry, and private industry has reaped the benefits. Likewise, in the academic realm, large-scale data science applications have also learned to apply public high-performance computing resources to make use of this technology. However, academic and research science gateways have yet to fully adopt the tools of AI. There is an opportunity in the gateways space, both to increase the visibility and accessibility to AI/ML applications and to enable researchers and developers to advance the field of science gateway cyberinfrastructure itself. Harnessing AI/ML is recognized as a high priority by the science gateway community. It is, therefore, critical for the next generation of science gateways to adapt to support the AI/ML that is already transforming many scientific fields. The goal is to increase collaborations between the two fields and to ensure that gateway services are used and are valuable to the AI/ML community. This chapter presents state-of-the-art examples and areas of opportunity for the science gateways community to pursue in relation to AI/ML and some vision of where these new capabilities might impact science gateways and support scientific research.},

	abstract = {Fuel cycle simulator development started many years ago by several research and engineering institutions or consulting firms for a wide range of applications. To improve confidence in the results, institutions may be tempted to increase the complexity of their software even if this complexity might not be necessary. On the other hand, some simulators may be used outside their range of validity when used in very specific applications. The FIT (Functionality Isolation Test) project is an international effort devoted to improve the confidence in the data produced by fuel cycle simulation tools. The scientific goal is to determine the optimum level of detail a fuel cycle simulator needs according to the type of study and the required confidence level. The project relies on a wide variety of fuel cycle simulators with a large range of complexity levels. The FIT project consists of isolating the impact of one targeted functionality on fuel cycle simulations. The impact of the functionality is assessed using a set of simple basic exercises specifically designed for this purpose, called ”functionality isolation.” The present work focuses on the impact on simulation results of using a fuel loading model (a relation that links the stock isotopic composition with the fresh fuel fabrication according to the reactor requirements) or a fixed fraction approach (the fresh fuel fissile fraction is fixed and does not depend on the stock isotopic composition). The paper first presents the FIT project. The exercise design is described and results show that using a fuel loading model approach has an important impact on fuel cycle outputs under certain conditions that are described. This result is reinforced by the fact that all fuel cycle simulators used in this exercise provide similar conclusions.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1877339},
	abstract = {This project is dedicated towards designing a fuel processing system that enables liquid-fueled molten salt reactors (MSR) to load follow by removing the dissolved xenon in the fuel salt. As one of the Gen-IV nuclear reactor concepts, the molten salt reactor receives increasing development interests in the recent years. One distinguishing feature of the liquid-fueled molten salt reactor is its improved ability to operate in a load-following mode by including the unique online fission product removal system. Load-following means that the reactor changes its power output based on the demand on the grid. Most of the current operating nuclear reactors have limited load-following ability and operate as the base load on the grid. Due to the rapid increase of solar energy, the requirement on load-following capacity is significantly increased because of the varying power output of the solar panels, yet the traditional load-following capacity is expected to decrease as the decarbonization of the grid continues. Therefore, the ability to perform load-following operation for the nuclear reactors will greatly enhance the resilience of the grid and make nuclear energy more economically competitive. This load-following feature is included in many commercial molten salt reactor designs, such as the designs by Transatomic Power, Terrestrial Energy, and Flibe Energy. Unfortunately, detailed analysis of the fuel processing system for commercial scale MSRs is still lacking, as well as how the fuel processing quantitively impacts the load-following operation. Moreover, experimental data for many of the underlying physics of fuel processing is limited. This project aims to pave the way for the fuel processing technology to advance to the commercial stage by performing combined experimental and simulation research. During the project period, four interconnected aspects of the development of the fuel processing system in liquid-fueled molten salt reactors are investigated. These aspects are the simulation and analysis of the fission product removal system, the fuel cycle simulation, the coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation, and the gaseous fission product removal experiment. Multiphase CFD simulations are performed for components of the processing systems, and simplified air-water experiments are carried out to provide validation data. It is concluded that the CFD simulation can satisfactorily predict the system level performance of the components, and engineering models are constructed based on this success. Fuel cycle analysis is performed for two representative MSR design, the MSBR and the Transatomic Power MSR. Open-source code SaltProc is developed to incorporate the unique fuel processing system of the MSRs. It is concluded that the removal of xenon is essential for load-following operation in thermal spectrum MSR and Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. For the Transatomic Power MSR, the xenon poisoning effect is negligible due to its relatively fast neutron spectrum, though the overall fuel cycle economics still benefits from the removal of xenon. Coupled reactor neutronics and thermal hydraulics transient simulation is performed specifically for the Transatomic Power MSR. It is concluded that the reactor core design could perform power ramping fast enough to satisfy load-following operation. Combining the findings from each aspect, it is concluded that the load-following operation of a thermal neutron MSR is dependent upon the removal of xenon, which could be achieved for a commercial sized reactor using continuous inert gas sparging in a separate system with reasonable dimensions.},

	abstract = {The United States is considering the deployment of advanced reactors that require uranium enriched between 5-20\% 235U, often referred to as High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). At the present, there are no commercial facilities in the US to produce HALEU, prompting questions of how to create a dependable supply chain of HALEU to support these reactors. HALEU can be produced through two primary methods: downblending High Enriched Uranium (HEU) and enriching natural uranium. The amount of HEU available and impurities present in the HEU limit downblending capabilities. The Separative Work Unit (SWU) capacity and amount of natural uranium available limit enriching natural uranium capabilities. To understand the resources necessary to commercially produce HALEU with each of these methods, one can quantify the material requirements of transitioning to HALEU-fueled reactors. 

In this dissertation, we model the transition from Light Water Reactors to different advanced reactors, considering once-through and closed fuel cycles to determine material requirements for supporting these fuel cycles. Material requirements of interest across this work include the mass of enriched uranium, mass of HALEU, feed uranium, SWU capacity, and the mass of used fuel sent for disposal. We use CYCLUS and publicly-available information about Light Water Reactors, the X-energy Xe-100, the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor, and the NuScale VOYGR to model potential transition scenarios and demonstrate the methodologies developed in this work. To more accurately model the closed fuel cycles, we develop a new CYCLUS archetype, called OpenMCyclus, that couples with OpenMC to dynamically model fuel depletion in a reactor and provide more accurate used fuel compositions. The results of this transition analysis show how the characteristics of the advanced reactors deployed drive the materials required to support the fuel cycle. Closing the fuel cycle reduces the materials required, but the reduction in materials is driven by the amount of material available for reprocessing. 

To gain more insight into how transition parameters not considered in the transition analysis affect material requirements, we perform sensitivity analysis on one of the once-through transitions by coupling CYCLUS with Dakota. The results of the sensitivity analysis highlight some of the trade-offs between different reactor designs. One such tradeoff is the increased HALEU demand but decreased used fuel discharged when increasing the Xe-100 deployment and decreasing the VOYGR deployment. Additionally, these results identify the Xe-100 discharge burnup as consistently being one of the most impactful input parameters for this transition, because of how the deployment scheme in this work affects the number of Xe-100s built no matter which advanced reactor build share is specified.

To identify potential transitions that minimize material requirements, we then use the CYCLUS-Dakota to optimize a once-through transition using the genetic algorithms in Dakota. In single-objective problems to minimize the SWU capacity required to produce HALEU and minimize the amount of used nuclear fuel, the algorithm finds solutions that are consistent with the results of the sensitivity analysis. The results cannot be taken at face value, because the algorithm did not fully converge and the genetic algorithms do not enforce the applied linear constraint for the advanced reactor build shares to sum to 100\%. However, the results provide guidance on how to adjust the input parameters to optimize the transition for a minimal HALEU SWU or the used fuel mass. Parameter adjustments include maximizing the number of Light Water Reactors that receive license extensions to operate for 80 years. Similar results occur when using this method for a multi-objective problem to minimize both the HALEU SWU capacity and the used fuel mass. 

Finally, we use neutronics models of the Xe-100 and Micro Modular Reactor reactor designs to evaluate the steady-state reactor physics performance of downblended HEU in these two designs. We compare the performance of the downblended HEU to nominally enriched fuel, based on the k-eff, βeff, energy- and spatially-dependent neutron fluxes, as well as the fuel, moderator, coolant, and total reactivity temperature feedback coefficients. The differences in the fuel compositions leads to differences in each of the metrics. However, these differences are within error of the results of the nominally enriched fuel, or would not prevent the reactor from meeting stated design specifications or operating in a safe state.

The work completed in this dissertation develops and demonstrates a methodology for modeling fuel cycle transitions and understanding the effects of deploying HALEU-fueled reactors in the US. The effects investigated in these example scenarios include various materials and resources required to support these reactors, and how the parameters of the transition affect these requirements. The information generated from this new methodology can be used to develop the necessary infrastructure and supply chains for support a transition to HALEU-fueled reactors. Furthermore, this work explores how the HALEU production method (enriching compared with downblending) affects reactor performance.},

	abstract = {A versatile, parallelizable Python 2.7 library was developed in order to simulate once-through molten salt reactor depletion in a realistic manner via the coupled neutronics/depletion code Serpent 2. Realistic in this sense entails two aspects: reactivity of the core, and oxidation potential of the fuel. The core reactivity should be maintained near zero as with any nuclear reactor. Gross reactivity control is provided by variations of the refuel rate of the reactor. Fine reactivity adjustments are expected to be done with control mechanisms in real-life power operation. The Python library developed allows a user to set bounds on the desired ke f f value. Fuel oxidation potential must be controlled for any liquid fueled reactor. As a simple example, consider this fission where the fuel becomes more oxidizing: UF\{sub 4\} → SrF\{sub 2\} + Xe + 2F\{sup -\} It can be shown using expected fission product oxidation state data that for these reactors, the fuel will become more oxidizing over time as a result of accumulation of excess fluoride ion. Addition of a reducing agent to reactor fuel will be necessary in the operation of molten salt reactors.},

	abstract = {Liquid fueled molten salt reactor modeling can be challenging, as the fuel composition varies temporally and spatially. Although these models are challenging, they are important for predicting reactor safety and performance during operation. One of the reasons these models are challenging is the difficulty in capturing different physical phenomena which occur in different time scales. Over short time scales, one of these physical phenomena is the movement of delayed neutron precursors to less important regions of the reactor.
For longer time scales, one of these physical phenomena is online reprocessing, which includes adding fresh fuel and removing fission products from the reactor during operation and is the focus of this work. Reprocessing is useful in liquid fueled molten salt reactors because it limits chemical corrosion and improves the neutron economy. Reprocessing can be performed continuously during operation, referred to as online reprocessing, or in batches during outages, referred to as batchwise reprocessing. In order to simulate reprocessing computationally, there are two different mathematical approaches which are commonly implemented in the literature, called batchwise and continuous reprocessing. The continuous reprocessing method is more physically reflective of reactors using a chemically continuous reprocessing scheme. However, there are many works which have implemented batchwise reprocessing methods to simulate a physically continuous reprocessing process. In this thesis, I show that continuous reprocessing and batchwise reprocessing methods are not interchangeable. Using both methods on the same system shows that there are non-trivial differences in the results. I also investigate the computational cost of different reprocessing methods by performing a depletion time step refinement study. In this study, I found that continuous reprocessing allows for significantly larger time steps without large increases in error, which reduces computational cost. However, continuous reprocessing does not necessarily keep the overall mass constant, thus potentially leading to a nonphysical solution. I compare the differences between both methods while determining the effect of this nonphysical mass change caused by continuous reprocessing.},

	abstract = {Nuclear research reactors enable a wide range of applications and support the development of multiple fields, including energy production, isotope production, space discovery, among others. Research reactor safety analyses demonstrate the contribution of the operational procedures to the prevention of accidents, focusing mainly on the reactor core. These analyses rely on the assumption of heat being locally deposited in the core after shutdown. This work, however, is concerned with research reactor experiments, and it investigates more detailed methods targeting the specific reactor regions hosting the experiments.

Additionally, research reactor experiments require the development of individual experiment safety analyses, which due to the lack of a streamlined workflow becomes effort and time-consuming as well as error-prone. This thesis supports the development of safety analyses for research reactor experiments with the objective of streamlining the calculation procedure as well as accelerating it. The methodology presented here calculates the delayed heating in experiments, generates the volumetric heat source term for thermal-fluids calculations, solves the experiment temperature evolution during a channel draining event, and determines if the event leads to a radioactive material release. Moreover, this work examines methods to accelerate the calculation, which include the creation of a generic material irradiation database and data-based modeling.

This thesis starts with a literature survey summarizing previous work relevant to delayed heating calculations, transport/depletion solvers, and machine learning applied to nuclear engineering. The conclusions of the survey guide the choice of methods for the delayed heating calculation and the choice of machine learning algorithms for the data-based modeling.

The following chapters focus on the calculation workflows. This thesis establishes a delayed heating calculation workflow based on the formal three-step method that builds on top of the MCNP-ORIGEN Activation Automation (MOAA) tool. This workflow is demonstrated and verified with several exercises, which also ease the workflow visualization. The workflow is also demonstrated in two full-size research reactors, for which the heat in the structures and an experiment are calculated.

A simple modification of the delayed heating calculation workflow generates a shutdown dose rate calculation workflow as a value-added. This calculation workflow helps guide the post-irradiation examination (PIE) of experiments and helps prevent the unnecessary exposure of personnel and surrounding equipment. The calculation workflow is demonstrated for a Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO)-fueled experiment which highlights the applicability of this workflow to more complex geometries, such as High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs).

When focusing on the acceleration of the calculations, this thesis proposes the generic material irradiation database method. This method relies on the delayed heating calculation workflow to obtain the heat produced in experiments of individual chemical elements and through their combination calculate the heat produced in experiments of arbitrary material composition. This thesis verifies this method by studying a vast range of materials that could be used in a research reactor experiment.

Moreover, this thesis investigates the applicability of data-based modeling to predict the outcome of the most thermally challenging accident in an experiment, a channel draining event. The data preparation process and several machine learning algorithms are described before studying a simplified model. Several useful conclusions are drawn with the simplified model before scaling it up, with some minor modifications, to a full-size reactor experiment.

Finally, this thesis wraps up with the conclusions from all the previous calculations. Overall, the results presented in this thesis meet this thesis’ objectives and prove that the proposed methodology decreases the computational expense and enables quick calculations supporting research reactor experiments.},
