<p>This <a href="/manual/guides/writing/checklist">writing checklist</a> is mostly from advice in this  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/">massively open online course</a>. You can take it yourself for free at your own pace.</p>

<h2 id="reviewing-writing">Reviewing Writing</h2>

<p>Use these lists to check off your progress in writing and reviewing.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] Run a spell checker.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Get rid of unnecessary prepositional phrases -- author clearing throat (e.g., "It can be shown that...").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Get rid of extraneous adverbs (very, really, quite, basically, generally).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Get rid of there are/there is.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Get rid of extraneous prepositions ("the meeting happened on Monday" -&gt; "the meeting happened Monday") ("they agreed that it was true" -&gt; "they agreed it was true").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Get rid of passive voice (is/was/are/were/be/been/am + past tense verb), replace with active voice.
<span class="p">-</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv"> ] Cite all images, methods, software, and empirical data.

<h2 id="enhancing-clarity">Enhancing Clarity</h2>

<p>As Shakespeare wrote in <em>Hamlet</em>, “Brevity is the soul of wit.”</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] Be concise and direct.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Using "very" suggests that a better word exists; replace it where possible.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Make sure that articles such as "a," "the," "some," "any," and "each" appear where necessary.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Ensure all subjects must match the plurality of their verbs (saying "Apples is tasty" is wrong, but "Apples are tasty" is correct).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Recover verbs that were turned into nouns ("obtain estimates of" -&gt; "estimates"; "provides a description of" -&gt; "describes").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Use the form <span class="nt">&lt;noun&gt;</span> <span class="nt">&lt;verb&gt;</span>ion over <span class="nt">&lt;verb&gt;</span>ion of <span class="nt">&lt;noun&gt;</span> (for example, convert "calculation of velocity" to "velocity calculation").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Reduce vague words like "important" or "methodologic."
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Reduce acronyms/jargon.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Expand all acronyms on first use (rely on the acros.tex file and glossaries package to automate this).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Turn negatives to positives (she was not often right -&gt; she was usually wrong).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Do not bury the verb (keep the predicate close to the subject at the beginning of the sentence).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Refer to software consistently by name.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Italicize unusual or unfamiliar words or phrases when you use them.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] If you use an uncommon word, consider changing it or defining it in its first usage.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="enhancing-style">Enhancing Style</h2>

<p>You are a human writing for other humans: Make the wording exciting, and remember your audience includes readers who might not know as much jargon as you.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] Vary your sentence structure to keep readers engaged.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Do not use contractions in technical writing.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Use punctuation to help you to vary your sentence structure.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Follow the convention that the power to separate is (in order of increasing power): comma, colon, em dash, parentheses, semicolon, and period.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] In increasing order of formality: dash, parentheses, all others. Do not overdo the em dash and parentheses.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Check that if there's a list in a sentence, it shouldn't come before the colon.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Always use isotopic notation like <span class="sb">`$^{239}Pu$`</span>. Never <span class="sb">`$Pu-239$`</span> or <span class="sb">`$plutonium-239$`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Strengthen your verbs (use sparingly: is, are, was, were, be, been, am).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Only use "large" when referring to size.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Do not use the word "when" unless referring to a time (try "if" instead).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Clarify or change misused/overused words where necessary (e.g., code, input, output, different, value, amount, model).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Each sentence/paragraph should logically follow the previous sentence/paragraph.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Examples should use variables instead of numbers and symbolic math instead of acronyms.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="enhancing-grammar">Enhancing Grammar</h2>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] "Data" is plural (e.g., "the data are critical").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Compare to (point out similarities between different things) vs. compared with (point out differences between similar things)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Elemental symbols (Ni, Li, Na, Pu) are capitalized, but their names are not (nickel, lithium, sodium, plutonium).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Do not use the word "where" unless referring to a location (try "such that," or "in which").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Avoid run-on sentences.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] The preposition "of" shows belonging, relations, or references. The preposition "for" shows purpose, destination, amount, or recipients. They are not interchangeable.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="enhancing-punctuation">Enhancing Punctuation</h2>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] Commas and periods go inside end quotes, except when there is a parenthetical reference afterward.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Colons and semicolons go outside closed quotations.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] A semicolon connects two independent clauses OR separates items when the list contains internal punctuation.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Use a colon to introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] The Oxford comma must appear in lists (e.g., "lions, tigers, and bears").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Use hyphens to join words acting as a single adjective before a noun (e.g., "well-known prankster"), not after a noun (e.g., "the prankster is well known").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Two words joined by a hyphen in title case should both be capitalized.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Hyphens join a prefix to a capitalized word, figure, or letter (e.g., pre-COVID, T-cell receptor, post-1800s); compound numbers (e.g., sixty-six); words to the prefixes ex, self, and all (e.g., ex-sitter, self-made, all-knowing); and words to the suffix elect (e.g., president-elect).

<h2 id="using-latin">Using Latin</h2>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] The Latin abbreviations viz., i.e., and e.g. should all have commas before and after them (e.g., "We can classify a large star as a red giant, e.g., Stephenson 2-18").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] The Latin abbreviations cf., et al., or q.v. should not automatically have commas after them.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] The abbreviation of <span class="ge">*versus*</span> (vs.) should always have a period in American English and is used to contrast things.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] You should never say "and etc.", because "et" means and in Latin.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Abbreviations including "et" should not have a period after "et" because it is a whole word.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Some abbreviations need capitalization (e.g., "N.B.," which means "note well").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Latin (or any non-English) words other than et are usually italicized (e.g., <span class="ge">*in situ*</span>, <span class="ge">*in vivo*</span>, <span class="ge">*in vitro,*</span> and <span class="ge">*ab initio*</span>).
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="tables-and-figures">Tables and Figures</h2>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] The text should refer to all tables and figures.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] When referring to figures by their number, use <span class="sb">`Figure 1`</span> and <span class="sb">`Table 1.`</span> They should be capitalized and not abbreviated (not <span class="sb">`fig. 1`</span> or <span class="sb">`figure 1`</span>).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Align all columns of numbers in tables such that the decimals line up.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] All values should probably have the same number of significant digits in a single column.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Give units for each numerical column.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] A table should have only three horizontal lines (no vertical lines and no more than three).
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="enhancing-math">Enhancing Math</h2>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] Define all variables with units. If unitless, indicate this is the case <span class="sb">`$[-]$`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Subscripts should be brief and can be avoided with common notation. For example, <span class="sb">`$\dot{m}$`</span> is better than <span class="sb">`$m_f$`</span> which is superior to <span class="sb">`$m_{flow}$`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Variable names should be symbols rather than words <span class="sb">`m`</span> is better than <span class="sb">`mass`</span> and <span class="sb">`\ksi`</span> is better than <span class="sb">`one_time_use_variable`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] The notation <span class="sb">`$3.0\times10^{12}$`</span> is preferred over <span class="sb">`$3e12$`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Equations should be part of a sentence.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Equations should be in the <span class="sb">`align`</span> environment. Align them at the <span class="sb">`=`</span> sign.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Variables should be defined in the <span class="sb">`align`</span> environment, not buried in paragraphs.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s an example of an equation:</p>
<div class="language-latex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A line has the form
<span class="nt">\begin{align}</span>
y<span class="p">&amp;</span>=mx + b
<span class="k">\intertext</span><span class="p">{</span>where<span class="p">}</span>
y<span class="p">&amp;</span>= <span class="k">\mbox</span><span class="p">{</span> height of the line, also known as rise [m]<span class="p">}</span><span class="k">\nonumber\\</span>
m<span class="p">&amp;</span>= <span class="k">\mbox</span><span class="p">{</span> slope [-]<span class="p">}</span><span class="k">\nonumber\\</span>
