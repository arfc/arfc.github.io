I"p<p>As the first semester of the ARFC group begins this fall, Iâ€™m excited to 
announce that a number of researchers will join the group.</p>

<p>Alexander Lindsay will be joining us a postdoctoral scholar. He received his
undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Washington
and received his PhD this summer from North Carolina State University. He will
be joining ARFC as well as the <a href="https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/">Data Exploration Laboratory
(DXL)</a> led by Matthew Turk. His activities will
emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics and his collaboration with
DXL may advance visual exploration of simulation results.</p>

<p>Andrei Rykhlevskii will be joining the group as a PhD student. He has a degree
in Nuclear Engineering from Bauman Moscow State Technical University as well as
a Masters of Science in Finanace from the Financial University in Moscow. His
work will likely also emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics.</p>

<p>Additionally, a small team of undergraduate researchers will join the group 
this year.  These include Kathryn Mummah and Jin Whan Bae of NPRE as well as 
Matthew Worley and Yukun Tan who will join us through the <a href="http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/">NCSA 
SPIN</a> program.</p>

<p>With the help of all of these researchers, I expect ARFC will really be able to
hit the ground running.</p>
