I"¦<h1 id="traveling">Traveling</h1>

<p>If personal travel (e.g. vacation)
will have an impact on research goals and meeting attendance. 
please communicate as soon as possible with Prof. Huff regarding scheduling and 
expectations. Beyond this, please simply submit a <a href="https://my.npre.illinois.edu/travel/request/?section=absence">travel request
form</a> to register
your absence for any personal travel impacting your availability.</p>

<p>Traveling for ARFC purposes (conferences, workshops, etc.) should be done in these steps:</p>

<h2 id="1-plan-ahead">1. Plan Ahead!</h2>

<p>You will need :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A duration.</strong> For example, you may want to travel from April 9th to 13th.</li>
  <li><strong>A destination.</strong> For example, you might be traveling to Charlotte, NC.</li>
  <li><strong>A purpose for travel.</strong> Perhaps you want to attend the International High Level Radioactive Waste Conference.</li>
  <li><strong>A justification for travel.</strong> For example, you may want to present an 
accepted paper. Prof. Huff is not likely to approve travel if the student has 
no research to present.</li>
  <li><strong>Release from campus duties.</strong> If you are in classes, determine a plan for 
making up homework and exams. If you are a TA, make sure you communicate with 
your supervisor, the course instructor, regarding the absence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-create-a-budget">2. Create a budget.</h2>

<p>You will need to estimate the cost of the trip. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Flights.</strong> Find an example itinerary.</li>
  <li><strong>Hotel.</strong> Check if there is a discount provided by the conference.</li>
  <li><strong>Registration Fee.</strong> If this conference requires registration, how much?</li>
  <li><strong>Other items.</strong> Cabs, bus rides, per diemâ€¦</li>
  <li><strong>Offsets.</strong> Can you apply for a travel grant? Is there a student program to 
reimburse costs?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-decide--pre-paid-or-reimbursed">3. Decide : Pre-Paid or reimbursed?</h2>

<p>Once you have created a budget, decide whether you would like to make these 
purchases yourself (to be reimbursed later) or if you would prefer these 
purchases to be prepaid by the department. <strong>note: If you want to pay and get 
reimbursed, it can take as much as 5 months to receive reimbursement.</strong></p>

<h2 id="4-get-approval-from-prof-huff">4. Get approval from Prof. Huff.</h2>
<p>Email or set up a meeting. She will need all of the above information to give 
her approval.</p>

<h2 id="5-submit-a-travel-request-form">5. Submit a Travel Request Form</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="my.npre.illinois.edu">my.npre.illinois.edu</a> -&gt; HR APPS -&gt; Travel</li>
  <li>Click â€˜Create Requestâ€™</li>
  <li>List Prof. Huff (kdhuff) as your supervisor.</li>
  <li>Fill out the form.</li>
  <li>The account number must be provided by Prof. Huff <strong>Note: It differs by 
what grant you are under! Never use someone elseâ€™s!</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-wait-for-approval-by-the-supervisor">6. Wait for approval by the supervisor</h2>

<p>If it seems to be taking a while, check in with Prof. Huff. She, or someone 
else in the chain, may have missed the approval email.</p>

<h2 id="7-make-purchases">7. Make purchases</h2>

<p>Please see this completed quickly. Itâ€™s best to get government rates for the 
hotel where the conference is at. Airbnb can be unreliable.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If the department will make the purchases,</strong> work closely with Prof. Huff 
and the department staff to make these purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>If youâ€™re going to make the purchases yourself</strong> go right ahead, and keep 
the receipts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8-go-on-the-trip-be-safe">8. Go on the trip. Be safe!</h2>

<p>Please note that even while on travel, students, staff, and faculty are 
representatives of the university and our ARFC research group.</p>

<h2 id="9-acquire-the-paper-travel-form">9. Acquire the Paper Travel Form</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the NPRE main office (Talbot 212) to pick up the Travel Itinerary 
Reimbursement Form. It will have an envelope attached to it.</li>
  <li>You have 60 days to complete  your Reimbursement Expense Report or it 
becomes taxable income.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="10-fill-out-the-paper-travel-form">10. Fill out the Paper Travel Form</h2>

<p>You mus be very very detailed, consider using the following strategy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write down your basic information (name, contact, account number etc)</li>
  <li>Print out a separate sheet for the descriptions
and writing â€˜SEE ATTACHEDâ€™ in the actual form <a href="/img/manual/guides/tra-example.pdf">example</a></li>
  <li>Print out all the receipts from the travel (airfare, registration, lodging are major ones)</li>
  <li>The table is PER DAY, which means that each row is a day</li>
  <li>For the first and last day, you must state the day of departure and arrival of your mode of transportation</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Per Diem - Circle meals requested</code> is where you circle meals that were NOT PROVIDED BY THE CONFERENCE, and the ones you had to pay for. The reimbursements are set as $6.50 for breakfast and lunch, and $19 for dinner, total up to $32 per day.</li>
  <li>Explain EVERYTHING at <code class="highlighter-rouge">Other details or further explanation</code>, and why it was of benefit to the University.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Recommendations and Tips:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>If you presented a paper (or a poster presentation), it is beneficial to 
attach a copy of your paper.</li>
  <li>Always try to include Who, What, When, Where, Why.</li>
  <li>Be EXTREMELY detailed (if you think â€˜do I really need this?â€™ - just attach 
it and write it)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11-get-the-form-signed">11. Get the form signed</h2>

<p>If Prof. Huff was the sponsor of the trip, she will need to sign the form.</p>
