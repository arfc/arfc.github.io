<h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] Run a spell checker.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] The Oxford comma must appears in lists ("lions, tigers, and bears.")
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Do not use the word "where" unless referring to a location (try "such that" or "in which").
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Do not use the word "when" unless referring to a time (try "if" instead).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Only use "large" when referring to size.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Use of "very" suggests that a cooler word exists.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Other misused/overused words include: code, input, output, different, value, amount, model.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Articles such as "a" "the" "some" "any" and "each" must appear where necessary.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] All subjects match the plurality of their verbs ( no: "Apples is tasty" yes: "Apples are tasty")
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Avoid run-on sentences.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] clunky nouns -&gt; spunky verbs (progression, expression --&gt; progress, express)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] reduce vague words (important, methodologic)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] reduce acronyms / jargon
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] expand all acronyms on first use (rely on the acros.tex file and glossaries package to automate this)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] get rid of unnecessary prepositional phrases -- author clearing throat (It can be shown that)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] get rid of extraneous adverbs (very, really, quite, basically, generally)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] get rid of there are / there is
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] turn negatives to positives (she was not often right -&gt; she was usually wrong)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] get rid of extraneous prepositions (the meeting happened on monday -&gt; the meeting happened monday) (they agreed that it was true -&gt; they agreed it was true)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] get rid of passive voice (is/was/are/were/be/been/am + past tense verb), replace with active voice
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] use strong verbs (use sparingly: is, are, was, were, be, been, am)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] avoid turning verbs into nouns ("obtain estimates of" -&gt; "estimates"; "provides a description of" -&gt; "describes")
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] don't bury the verb (keep the predicate close to the subject at the beginning of the sentence)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] data is plural (the data are critical)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] compare to (point out similarities between different things) vs.  compared with (point out differences between similar things)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] punctuation helps you to vary your sentence structure
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Power to separate in increasing power: comma, colon, dash, parentheses, semicolon, period
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] In increasing order of formality: dash, parentheses, all of the others. Don't overdo it with the dash and parentheses
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] semicolon: connects two independent clauses. OR used to separate when the items in the list contain internal punctuation.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] use a colon to introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] if there's a list in a sentence, it shouldn't come before the colon
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] use a dash to insert something in the middle of the sentence. Don't overuse it.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Always use isotopic notation like <span class="sb">`$^{239}Pu$`</span>. Never $Pu-239$ or plutonium-239.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Elemental symbols (Ni, Li, Na, Pu) are capitalized, but their names are not (nickel, lithium, sodium, plutonium).
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] A phrase of the form <span class="nt">&lt;verb&gt;</span>ion of <span class="nt">&lt;noun&gt;</span> is probably clearer as <span class="nt">&lt;noun&gt;</span> <span class="nt">&lt;verb&gt;</span>ion. (For example, convert "calculation of velocity" to "velocity calculation".)
<span class="p">-</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv"> ] Cite all software. Review [the principles</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles</span><span class="p">)</span> and try <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">CiteAs</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">https://citeas.org/about</span><span class="p">)</span> if necessary.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Refer to software consistently by name.

<p>Additional Table and Figure Checklist:</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] The text should refer to all tables and figures.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] When referring to figures by their number, use <span class="sb">`Figure 1`</span> and <span class="sb">`Table 1.`</span> They should be capitalized and not abbreviated (not <span class="sb">`fig. 1`</span> or <span class="sb">`figure 1`</span>.)
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] In tables, align all columns of numbers such that the decimals line up.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] In a single column, all values should probably have the same number of significant digits.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Give units for each numerical column.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] A table should have only 3 horizontal lines (no vertical lines and no more than 3.)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additional Math Comments:</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> [ ] define all variables, with units. If unitless, indicate that this is the case <span class="sb">`$[-]$`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] subscripts should be brief and can be avoided with common notation. For example, <span class="sb">`$\dot{m}$`</span> is better than <span class="sb">`$m_f$`</span> which is superior to <span class="sb">`$m_{flow}$`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] variable names should be symbols rather than words <span class="sb">`m`</span> is better than <span class="sb">`mass`</span> and <span class="sb">`\ksi`</span> is better than <span class="sb">`one_time_use_variable`</span>.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] The notation $3.0<span class="se">\t</span>imes10^12$ is preferred over $3e12$.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Equations should be part of a sentence.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Equations should be in the <span class="sb">`align`</span> environment. Align them at the <span class="sb">`=`</span> sign.
<span class="p">-</span> [ ] Variables should be defined in the <span class="sb">`align`</span> environment as well, not buried in paragraphs.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example of an equation:</p>
<div class="language-latex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The line is defined as
<span class="nt">\begin{align}</span>
y<span class="p">&amp;</span>=mx + b
<span class="k">\intertext</span><span class="p">{</span>where<span class="p">}</span>
y<span class="p">&amp;</span>= <span class="k">\mbox</span><span class="p">{</span> height of the line, also known as rise [m]<span class="p">}</span><span class="k">\nonumber\\</span>
m<span class="p">&amp;</span>= <span class="k">\mbox</span><span class="p">{</span> slope [-]<span class="p">}</span><span class="k">\nonumber\\</span>
x<span class="p">&amp;</span>=<span class="k">\mbox</span><span class="p">{</span> independent parameter, known as run [m]<span class="p">}</span><span class="k">\nonumber\\</span>
b<span class="p">&amp;</span>= <span class="k">\mbox</span><span class="p">{</span> y intercept [m].<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nt">\end{align}</span>
