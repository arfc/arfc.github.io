<p>An oral presentation is typically prepared to 
summarize or disseminate work. They can serve as a 
an accountability checkpoint for an organization funding research, or as a means
to share discovery with a variety of technical and non-technical audiences.</p>

<h2 id="rules-of-the-presentation">Rules of the Presentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>After you have been invited/accepted to give an oral presentation, outline and prepare your presentation.</li>
  <li>Know your audience and determine the style of presentation that suits them best</li>
  <li>Remember, this presentation is an advert for your work</li>
  <li>Try to spend around two minutes per slide</li>
  <li>Present the body of your talk with slides titled as summaries or guiding questions</li>
  <li>People will remember your figures, not your bullets (a generalization, but well founded)</li>
  <li>Never put something on a slide you do not thoroughly and consistently, understand</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-the-presentation">Writing the Presentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All grammatical and technical errors must be eliminated per the writing checklist</li>
  <li>Do not leave a bulleted list hanging (i.e. without a title or lead-in sentence)</li>
  <li>Stick to simple backgrounds, one to two fonts, and use color as a secondary delimiter not a primary one</li>
  <li>Use a sans serif font for all text</li>
  <li>Use equations as a last resort (or sparingly if you are presenting a method), a plot/figure is much better at telling the whole story qualitatively</li>
  <li>Do not be afraid to put enlarged boxes over small text in images</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="presentation-review">Presentation Review</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you allot adequate time for run-throughs (plural!), and revisions from the group</li>
  <li>When the document has been thoroughly checked, request a review from Prof. Huff and the group</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-the-presentation-template">Using the Presentation Template</h2>

<p>In the ARFC Github organization, there are several template repositories designed to aid the 
writing/creating process by giving you a starting place for formatting. To use the 
<a href="https://github.com/arfc/presentation-template">report template</a>, select the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Use this Template</code> 
option next to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Code</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Use this Template</code> will generate a repository on your GitHub account with copies of all the 
files in the original, including the Readme file. The Readme will serve as your point of 
reference for how to initialize the documents and some common errors that occur upon initial 
startup. Keep in mind that this template has a
