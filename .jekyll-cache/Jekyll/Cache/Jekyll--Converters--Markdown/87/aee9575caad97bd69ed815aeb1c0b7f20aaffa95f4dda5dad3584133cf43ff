I"Ç<p>ARFC graduate student, <strong>Jin Whan Bae</strong>, Teddy for short, travelled to Seoul, 
South Korea in September to present a poster at the <a href="http://www.global2017.org/">GLOBAL 2017 Nuclear Fuel 
cycle Conference.</a></p>

<p>His poster, titled ‚ÄúCurrent Status of Predictive Transition Capability in Fuel 
Cycle Simulation,‚Äù was accompanied by a conference paper of the same name. It 
established the state of the art of predictive fuel cycle facility deployment 
in exising nuclear fuel cycle simulators.</p>

<p>Bae said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThanks to ARFC, I was able to network with professionals and academics
worldwide in my field. I think the experience and things I learned in the
conference will help me greatly in my research and my career.‚Äù</p>
