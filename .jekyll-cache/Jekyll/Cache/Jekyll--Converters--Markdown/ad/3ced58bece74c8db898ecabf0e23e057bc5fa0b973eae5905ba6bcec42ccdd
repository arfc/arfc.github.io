<p>Zotero is a convenient tool that allows a creation
of a nice, organized library that can be exported to
a .bib file later on!</p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>

<p>Start with the obvious by 
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/user/register/">creating an account</a> 
and joining the
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/arfc">arfc group library</a>.</p>

<h2 id="install-zotero-plugins">Install Zotero Plugins</h2>

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download">www.zotero.org/download</a> and follow the 
instructions to install the standalone app. It will additionally be helpful to 
have the browser extension.</p>

<p>If you use firefox:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download Zotero Firefox Application.</li>
  <li>Thatâ€™s it for now.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you use something else (e.g. Chrome):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the Zotero Standalone application.</li>
  <li>Add the Zotero extension to your browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="to-store-references">To Store References:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open Zotero Standalone.</li>
  <li>Go to a folder (either personal or group) in which youâ€™d like to store the reference.</li>
  <li>In your browser, navigate to the reference online (this is the tricky part)</li>
  <li>Click on the icon next to your address bar to â€˜save to Zoteroâ€™.</li>
  <li>Check the new entry in Zotero. Does it have a date, author, and title?</li>
  <li>If yes, youâ€™re done. If no, then enter these manually.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-tricky-part">The Tricky Part</h3>

<p>In order to â€˜properlyâ€™ store papers and refernces, one must do so with caution. 
If your browser extension shows a PDF icon, then it will only save the file, 
with no metadata. Ideally, you should navigate to a URL where a different icon 
is present (e.g. a folder icon, a journal article icon, or a conference 
presentation icon.)</p>

<h4 id="best-option-google-scholar">Best Option: Google Scholar</h4>

<p>Search for the article in <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>
This will most likely ensure that the browser plugin will have access to all
the necessary information for proper citing.</p>

<p><img src="/img/manual/guides/zot-gs.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>At this point, you can select one or multiple papers to add to Zotero. They 
will end up in the Zotero standalone directory that is currently open.</p>

<h4 id="journal-sources">Journal Sources</h4>

<p>If not in google scholar, you should aim to add the paper in the â€˜introduction 
pageâ€™ of the paper (Fig. 2), not the paper itself (Fig. 3).</p>

<p><img src="/img/manual/guides/zot-cite.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The above shows when you click â€˜save to Zoteroâ€™, not below.</p>

<p><img src="/img/manual/guides/zot-pdf.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>In the figure below, the results of clicking the icon in each case (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) can be seen in the two entries. See that the entry from Fig. 3 does not contain the author and year created. However, the entry resulting from the Fig. 2 click does have all the information. If information is missing, Zotero will struggle to make a useful bibliography for you.</p>

<p><img src="/img/manual/guides/zot-comparison.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>You can also try to maually get the data by right clicking the â€˜badâ€™ reference and clicking on 
â€˜Retrieve Metadata for PDFâ€™.  It can fail. In that case, you may just have to 
enter the information manually.</p>

<p>For Web Pages, just click the â€˜Save to Zoteroâ€™ icon.
If any crucial item is missing, type it in yourself.
To see when a website was last modified, type the following in the address bar:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">javascript:(alert(document.lastModified)</code></p>
