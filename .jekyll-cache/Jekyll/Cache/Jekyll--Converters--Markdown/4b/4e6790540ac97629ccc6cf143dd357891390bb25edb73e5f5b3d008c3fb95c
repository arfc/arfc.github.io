I"N<p>Two ARFC graduate students, <strong>Andrei Rykhlevskii</strong> and <strong>Anshuman Chaube</strong> were 
recognized this year by the American Nuclear Society at the national level with 
the <strong>2018 John and Muriel Landis Scholarship.</strong> This award, given by the ANS 
NEED Committee, consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and placement in 
the online archive of recipients on the <a href="http://www.ans.org/honors/scholarships/recipients/">ANS honors and awards 
website</a>.</p>

<p>This award recognizes students with exceptional potential in nuclear science and 
engineering who also pursue graduate school despite greater than average 
constraints. We applaud the committee’s selection of these two students. They 
each have chosen to pursue their graduate degrees in the face of all challenges 
presented to them. They each hold extraordinary promise as future nuclear 
engineering researchers.</p>

<p>Andrei joined ARFC in Fall 2016, and has made significant achievements in 
graduate research. He has successfully passed his qualifying exam and this 
semester he completed his MS degree. We are thrilled that he intends to 
continue toward his PhD in nuclear engineering. Andrei’s research work focuses 
on high performance multi-physics modeling and simulation and fuel cycle 
analysis of the molten salt breeder reactor.</p>

<p>Ansh joined ARFC in Fall 2017 and is already working toward two compelling 
projects. First, he is building a computational model of energy generation and 
consumption in Japan and is working toward dynamic transition analyses of a 
reduced carbon future. This work is supported as part of the I2CNER 
collaboration.  Additionally, Ansh has begun neutronics analysis in support of 
future multi-physics simulations of the Transatomic Power Reactor design.</p>

<p>ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we are particularly 
delighted to congratulate Andrei and Ansh on this award. It recognizes 
something of great importance to our mission : the humanity and dedication 
required to pursue an advanced degree in nuclear engineering.</p>
