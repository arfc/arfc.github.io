<p>Nuclear power is a key part of the worldâ€™s clean energy future.</p>

<h1 id="advances-in-safety-and-sustainability">Advances in Safety and Sustainability</h1>

<p>We seek to advance the safety and sustainability of nuclear energy production 
through improved reactor designs, fuel cycle strategies, and waste management 
techniques.</p>

<h1 id="insights-through-sophisticated-computing">Insights through Sophisticated Computing</h1>

<p>We choose to pursue these goals through crosscutting emphasis in sophisticated 
computing. Through advanced methods and simulations at many scales, we hope to 
gain novel insights into nuclear energy challenges.</p>

<h1 id="transparent-robust-extensible-science">Transparent, Robust, Extensible Science</h1>

<p>We strive to do science that advances the field. Fields advance through 
extensible, robust, reproducible work and transparent communication. Our work 
emphasizes software that is open, models that are well validated, and 
simulations that are repeatable and extensible.</p>
