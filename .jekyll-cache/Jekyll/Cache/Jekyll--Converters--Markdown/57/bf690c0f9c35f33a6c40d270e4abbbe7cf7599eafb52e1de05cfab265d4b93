<p>I would prefer that you do not list me as a reference unless you have asked me
first whether I would be willing to support your application.</p>

<h1 id="who-i-will-write-for">Who I will write for</h1>

<p>I am very happy to write a letter of reference for most people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>took at least one course from me</li>
  <li>worked in my research group</li>
  <li>collaborated with me or my research group</li>
  <li>or interacted with me in some other way relevant to the application</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, I consider letter writing an exercise in integrity. I seek to be
simultaneously as honest and generous as possible. Given this, please use your
judgement, based on our past interactions, about whether I would be a good
reference. If you are unsure about what kind of letter I would write for
you, perhaps I am the wrong choice of reference.</p>

<h1 id="asking">Asking</h1>

<p>If you’re ok with all of this, please write me a pleasant formal email indicating that you have read this
information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please make your request well in advance (at least a few weeks) before it will be due.</li>
  <li>Please don’t forget to <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2010/11/08/students-how-to-email-to-your-professor-employer-and-professional-peers/">write a professional email</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m going to need some information. 
Most importantly, if I don’t see you on a 
daily basis, please remind me how we know one another.</p>

<p>Please also provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your up-to-date CV or resume,</li>
  <li>a list of where the letters will go,</li>
  <li>ideally with links to descriptions of those positions,</li>
  <li>and the due dates for the references.</li>
  <li>Will they call me, ask for a letter via email, or send a form?</li>
  <li>Why do you think you are a good candidate?</li>
  <li>Are there any specific guidelines for the letter?</li>
</ul>

<p>For grad school, scholarship, or academic job market applications, in particular, I could be helped by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relevant application material (e.g. research statement, teaching statement, statement of intent)</li>
  <li>A reminder about any particular feature of you or your work that you are hoping I will address.</li>
