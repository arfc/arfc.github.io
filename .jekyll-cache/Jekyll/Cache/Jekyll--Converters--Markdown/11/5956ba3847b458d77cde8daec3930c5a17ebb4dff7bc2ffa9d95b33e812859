<h1 id="google-it">Google it</h1>

<p>Please don’t come to me with a question that can be solved by a Google search 
of the error. Especially if you are a Millenial from the U.S., Google really 
should be in your blood by now. For better google skills, consider 
<a href="http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com/course/aps/skills">powering up your search tactics</a>.</p>

<p>Once you google it, of course, try the things you found on google.</p>

<h1 id="stack-overflow">Stack Overflow</h1>

<p>If Google isn’t sufficiently refined, or if your code issue isn’t extremely 
urgent, consider asking your question on the largest programming bug forum in<br />
the solar system… <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. Be forewarned: the SO community 
is not always friendly or well-moderated for snark. That said, you can definitely improve your odds of kind 
answers by following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">these tips on asking a question 
well.</a>.</p>

<h1 id="check-your-environment">Check your environment</h1>

<p>There are a lot of ways that your programming environment can make things fail.</p>

<p>Execute the following commands, and ask yourself whether these values could 
explain your issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>echo $PATH</li>
  <li>echo $PYTHONPATH</li>
  <li>echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH</li>
  <li>echo $DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH</li>
  <li>which ‘insert your program here’</li>
  <li>which python</li>
  <li>which gcc</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t know how to interperet these runes, google around to find the 
meaning of these environment variables. Or, read the first chapter of <a href="http://physics.codes">the 
book</a>.</p>

<h1 id="debuggers-and-profilers">Debuggers and Profilers</h1>

<p>Try to debug with an interactive debugger or find memory errors with a 
profiler.  There is a section on debugging and profiling in <a href="http://physics.codes">the 
book</a>.</p>

<h1 id="minimal-working-example">Minimal Working Example</h1>

<p>To get the most out of your Stack Overflow question or your meeting with me, 
you will need to formulate a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal Working 
Example.</a></p>

<p>Yes, sometimes a minimal working example is hard to create. If that’s the case, 
I understand. However, you should still do what you can to document what you 
are trying to do, how you got where you are, how you tried to fix it. I will 
need this information to help you.</p>

<h1 id="contact-me">Contact me</h1>

<p>If you have tried <em>everything</em> above and nothing has been clarified, then 
should you email me.  The email should include your minimal working example or 
your detailed documentation of the problem (above). I may need a few days to 
look it over (so you may as well also add it to Stack Overflow in case they’re 
faster than me.) If I can’t help you fix it by email, I’ll let you know we 
should meet. If we need to meet, <a href="/manual/guides/katy/meeting">schedule a 
meeting.</a></p>
