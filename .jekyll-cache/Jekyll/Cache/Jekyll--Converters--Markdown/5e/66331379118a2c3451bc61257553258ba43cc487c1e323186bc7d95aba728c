<h2 id="advice-on-writing">Advice on Writing</h2>

<p>There is a ton of writing advice out there. Some exceptional advice is found below.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-write-a-lot">How to Write a Lot</h3>

<p>Prof. Huff loved
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Lot-Practical-Productive/dp/1591477433/ref=la_B001JP2K08_1_1">this book</a>
as a postdoc. <strong>The main lesson is that you should
write every day, not in occasional bursts.</strong></p>

<h3 id="create-a-writing-habit">Create a Writing Habit</h3>

<p>Here are some recommendations to help you make a habit of writing everyday:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> is
a powerful method for doing focused, deep, work. There are several apps you could
download to use this technique.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gnomepomodoro.org/">GNU Pomodoro</a> is an open source timer for Linux OS.</li>
      <li><a href="https://tomighty.github.io/">Tomighty</a> timer is an open source timer for Windows/Mac OS.</li>
      <li>A standard kitchen or watch timer also works!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use full screen word processor that blocks all distractions.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a> is a free, open source,
full screen word processor that can track daily goals, has built-in timers, and
colorful themes. Available on Ubuntu, Mac, or Windows.</li>
      <li><a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/writer/">ColdTurkeyWriter</a> is the <strong>nuclear option</strong> of
word processors. Once you open the app and set a goal (time or word count) 
you <em>cannot</em> exit the app until the goal is completed. Caveats: Only the basic version is
free (though you donâ€™t need much more), itâ€™s only available on Windows/Mac.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Have a distraction-free word processor open on computer start up. Doing this
forces you to write a certain number of words or for a certain length of time
before you can do anything else!</li>
</ol>
