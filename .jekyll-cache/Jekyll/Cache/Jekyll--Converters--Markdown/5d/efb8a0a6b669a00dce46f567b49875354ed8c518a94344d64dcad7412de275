I"-<p>Second year ARFC graduate student, <strong>Andrei Rykhlevskii</strong>, was recognized this year by the 
American Nuclear Society at the national level with a <strong>2017 John and Muriel 
Landis Scholarship.</strong> This award, given by the ANS NEED Committee,
consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and placement in 
the online archive of recipients on the <a href="http://www.ans.org/honors/scholarships/recipients/">ANS honors and awards 
website</a>.</p>

<p>This award recognizes students with exceptional potential in nuclear science 
and engineering who also pursue graduate school despite greater than average 
financial constraints. We applaud the committeeâ€™s selection of Andrei, who is 
simultaneously an exceptionally promising graduate student, a husband, and a 
father of two.</p>

<p>Andrei joined ARFC in Fall 2016, and has already made significant achievements 
in graduate research.  In particular, Andrei has completed a full 
core neutronic model of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor with unprecedented 
geometric detail. Additionally, he conducted an accompanying online fuel 
reprocessing analysis for that reactor.  For this work, Andrei consulted 
technically with Prof. Huff as well as the larger Serpent 2 neutronics 
simulation community. His dedication has resulted in a strong foundation for 
future multi-physics and fuel cycle analysis of molten salt breeder
reactor designs more broadly. This work culminated in two conference paper 
submissions to the 2017 American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting.</p>

<p>ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we are particularly 
delighted to congratulate Andrei on this award. It recognizes something of 
great importance to our mission : the humanity and dedication required to 
pursue an advanced degree in nuclear engineering.</p>
