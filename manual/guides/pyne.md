# A Brief Overview

PyNE is a library used for nuclear engineering, helping its users "be more productive, have the *best* solvers, have a beautiful API, write really great code, and teach the next generation". The [PyNE website](http://pyne.io/index.html) includes information about [installation](http://pyne.io/install/index.html) and a [tutorial](http://pyne.io/tutorial/index.html) on using PyNE.

# Development

PyNE is open source and free to use. Prof. Huff encourages contributions to PyNE, as its purpose is to provide a complete library meant to help all nuclear engineers. Anyone who feels that there should be something added or something changed is encouraged to develop changes. The website provides a [developer's guide](http://pyne.io/devsguide/index.html) to assist with testing, developing, and integration with PyNE, and the [Pyne GitHub](https://github.com/pyne/pyne) contains the source code. Prof. Huff is willing to help by offering some guidance on contributions, so any ideas on fixes or changes are encouraged.
