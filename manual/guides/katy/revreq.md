Reading and reviewing the work in the research group is a key responsibility of 
any research group leader. For me, it is also one of the most exciting 
parts of the job. When I ask you to send me something for review, I hope to 
look at it, make direct edits, and/or write up comments. 

# Formats

I really do not want to send word documents back and forth with you. The 
following options allow a more streamlined document collaboration:

- LaTeX in a git repository
- Markdown in a git repository
- Any markup language at all in a git repository
- A shared Google Docs file or folder
- A shared Box file or folder
- Overleaf

If you are working in one of the environments, please just point me to the 
repository or send me a link, ideally in a GitHub issue assigned to me. It 
helps if you link to or attached a built pdf. 

If, for whatever reason, you can't work in one of those frameworks, send me a 
PDF by email. It's a Portable Document Format after all. Word documents render 
differently on different machines, so if you send me a word document, I may 
complain about formatting you can't even see. Send me a pdf.

# Timelines

I, like other humans, need time to read things. This kind of work typically 
happens on my couch over the weekend or on the plane. So, timing your request 
around those things might (perhaps) speed up the turnaround time. 

## Under 1 page

If you have some short wording, a blog post, an abstract, a cover letter, or something else 
under a page, I should be able to get back to you within a few days. When I get 
your email, I'll either respond within the day or I'll let you know when to 
expect my comments.

## Under 100 pages

Longer items like manuscripts, conference summaries, and thesis chapters, will 
take a little longer. Plan ahead to give me two weeks to review these items. I 
may have significant edits, so include extra time before the deadline to allow 
yourself to make those edits. 

## Over 100 pages

If you have something like a dissertation or masters thesis that exceeds the 
amount of text I might be able to read in a day, please consider sending it to 
me in chunks. I need at least a month to read and comment on documents of this 
size. Again, add extra time before the deadline to make the edits I might 
suggest.

## Forgotten Reviews

I will typically acknowledge reciept of one of these review requests. At that 
point, I'll usually say how long I expect my response to take. I try very hard 
to honor these commitments, but sometimes things get lost. If I've gone past the 
deadline, please remind me. 

# Reading my comments

- Usually, whether or not you've sent me a pdf, I'll send 
  you a marked up pdf in return. This is because I usually read 
  these documents with my ipad and my stylus. 
  I try to match comments by color. If I send you a pdf like this, I'll likely 
  ask you to make all the contained changes yourself.
  My handwriting is inconsistent. If anything is unclear, please ask! 
- Sometimes, I'll directly edit and push my changes to the document on github 
  if that's possible and appropriate. 
- Other times, I'll submit my changes to your document with a pull request.
- If I have a question, I'll probably write it on the pdf or inline on a github 
  repository. Please answer those questions the next time we talk.
- Sometimes, if it's something larger, I might make a github issue capturing the 
  changes that need to be made.
