I look forward to speaking with you virtually or in person.

# How

I am always open to discuss new ideas with
colleagues, group members, students, and potential collaborators. My office
door is often open for this reason. Feel free to pop by. However, if you'd like 
to schedule a meeting, you're welcome to use the form described below. 


# When

Here's a url where you can pick a time and place that works for you: 
[katyhuff.youcanbook.me](http://katyhuff.youcanbook.me).  This form works best 
for scheduling meetings that I've already agreed to (including office hours or 
student advising meetings). Please email to request a meeting if you think this 
booking might be a surprise to me. 

This web app syncs with my calendars. The default duration is 30 minutes. If 
you need to meet for longer, please change the duration at the top left hand 
side of the form. Once you've filled it out, we'll both receive an email that 
confirms the details.

- If it's 5 minutes, try dropping by my office. 
- If it's 15 minutes, schedule me for a 15 minute meeting. 
- If it's 30 minutes, schedule me for a 30 minute meeting and come prepared.
- If it's longer than 30 minutes, are you sure?


However, please be aware that I
think my office hours work most effectively if I arrive prepared. To get the
most out of your time with me:

- Send a concise written description of the topic or question (a couple of paragraphs by email) at least a day or two before meeting.
- If you are coming to me with a programming conundrum, please see this [guide](/manual/guides/katy/codereq) before setting up a meeting
- If you would like to discuss data or theory, I recommend bringing ample diagrams, figures, and tables to our meeting for discussion.
- Like other humans, I usually need advance time to review something. See this [guide](/manual/guides/katy/revreq) on that topic.
