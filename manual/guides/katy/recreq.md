# Listing me as a reference

I would prefer that you do not list me as a reference unless you have asked me
first whether I would be willing to support your application.

# Who I will write for

I am very happy to write a letter of reference for most people who:

- took at least one course from me
- worked in my research group
- collaborated with me or my research group
- or interacted with me in some other way relevant to the application

In all cases, I consider letter writing an exercise in integrity. I seek to be
simultaneously as honest and generous as possible. Given this, please use your
judgement, based on our past interactions, about whether I would be a good
reference. If you are unsure about what kind of letter I would write for
you, perhaps I am the wrong choice of reference.

# Asking

If you're ok with all of this, please write me a pleasant formal email indicating that you have read this
information:

- Please make your request well in advance (at least a few weeks) before it will be due.
- Please don't forget to [write a professional email](http://chrisblattman.com/2010/11/08/students-how-to-email-to-your-professor-employer-and-professional-peers/).

I'm going to need some information. 
Most importantly, if I don't see you on a 
daily basis, please remind me how we know one another and when we met (what 
year). 

Please also provide:

- Your up-to-date CV or resume,
- including your GPA and student status.
- A list of where the letters will go,
- ideally with links to descriptions of those positions,
- and the due dates for the references.
- Will they call me, ask for a letter via email, or send a form?
- Why do you think you are a good candidate?
- Are there any specific guidelines for the letter?

For grad school, scholarship, or academic job market applications, in particular, I could be helped by:

- Relevant application material (e.g. research statement, teaching statement, statement of intent)
- A reminder about any particular feature of you or your work that you are hoping I will address.


## If you were a student in my course(s)

Please remind me:

- which course(s) you took
- what semester(s) and year(s)
- what grade(s) you were awarded
- particular elements of your performance that you are proud of


## If you conducted research work with me: 

Please remind me:

- When did you begin working for me?
- When did you cease to work for me?
- What were your major responsibilities?
- What work are you most proud of?



## If you know me through a student organization (ANS, WiN, THW... )

Please remind me:

- When was this?
- What student organization(s) were you involved in?
- What were our primary interactions?
- What kinds of activities were you involved in?
- Did you occupy an executive committee position (please list, with dates)?
- What are you most proud of regarding this activity?
