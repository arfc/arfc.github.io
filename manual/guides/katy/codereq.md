# Google it

Please don't come to me with a question that can be solved by a Google search 
of the error. In these modern times, Google really 
should be in your blood by now.

Once you google it, of course, try the things you found on google, take notes, 
and read the errors for clues. 

# Stack Overflow

If Google isn't sufficiently refined, or if your code issue isn't extremely 
urgent, consider asking your question on the largest programming bug forum in the solar system... [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). Be forewarned: the SO community 
is not always friendly or well-moderated for snark. That said, you can definitely improve your odds of kind 
answers by following [these tips on asking a question 
well.](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

# Check your environment

There are a lot of ways that your programming environment can make things fail. 

Execute the following commands, and ask yourself whether these values could 
explain your issues:

- echo $PATH
- echo $PYTHONPATH
- echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- echo $DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
- which 'insert your program here'
- which python
- which gcc

If you don't know how to interperet these runes, google around to find the 
meaning of these environment variables. Or, read the first chapter of [the 
book](http://physics.codes).

# Debuggers and Profilers

Try to debug with an interactive debugger or find memory errors with a 
profiler.  There is a section on debugging and profiling in [the 
book](http://physics.codes). 

# Minimal Working Example

To get the most out of your Stack Overflow question or your meeting with me, 
you will need to formulate a [Minimal Working 
Example.](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)

Yes, sometimes a minimal working example is hard to create. If that's the case, 
I understand. However, simply the act of creating one is often enough to 
provide clues about the source of the error. As you proceed, please do what you 
can to document what you are trying to do, how you got where you are, how you 
tried to fix it. I will need this information to help you.

# Collaborate

You're probably in the office as you're doing your research, so you have an 
excellent resource very nearby! Your colleagues! You might just show them the 
error you're dealing with, or share your minimal working example on GitHub.  
Either way, try discussing it in person or on Slack with the other students, 
and maybe they can help.

# Contact me

There should be ample opportunities to ask me quick questions about what you 
can try to solve your bug -- try to drop by Coffee Chat or pop by my office if 
you think it'll only take a few minutes and my door is open. 

If you have tried _everything_ above and nothing has been clarified,  and you 
think it might take a while to debug, then 
should you email me or Slack message me.  If possible, it should point to details somewhere (ideally 
GitHub or a Gist) about your minimal working example or 
your detailed documentation of the problem (above). I may need a few days to 
look it over (so you may as well also add it to Stack Overflow in case they're 
faster than me.) If I can't help you fix it by email, I'll let you know we 
should meet. If we need to meet, [schedule a 
meeting.](/manual/guides/katy/meeting)
