# Undergraduate Students

A list of courses for all students can be found
[here](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/npre/).
For undergraduate students, the NPRE department has compiled an interactive suggested course sequence for undergraduate students, which can be found
[here](https://npre.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/curriculum).
Undergraduate Students should meet with their faculty advisor each semester to
discuss what other courses they need to take to satisfy their degree
requirements. They should bring with them a copy of their DARS report
as well as a plan for the coming semester.

It's recommended for undergraduate students to stick to the suggested sequence
because some classes are offered only in one half of the school year.
The suggested sequence accounts for this and plans accordingly. For students
who test out of any classes, it's important that you talk with your
advisor and make sure there are no foreseeable conflicts.

# Undergraduate Checklist

# Graduate Students

Each graduate student in ARFC should have a folder in Google Drive shared
between them and Prof. Huff. In that folder should be a Student Plan in the
form of a spreadsheet.

Before registration for the coming semester, which is around the end of April
for the coming Fall semester or the beginning of November for the
coming Spring semester, graduate students should fill out their course plan
and discuss it with Prof. Huff. Use these links to find the course
requirements for the
[MS degree](http://catalog.illinois.edu/graduate/engineering/nuclear-plasma-radiological-engineering-ms/) and
[PhD degree](http://catalog.illinois.edu/graduate/engineering/nuclear-plasma-radiological-engineering-phd/).

Early Research Assistantship students should be taking 2-3 graduate classes
per semester and 4-8 research credit hours. Later, students typically
take one or fewer graduate classes per semester and fill the rest of their
necessary hours with research credits.

After Prof. Huff approves your course plan in the Student Record, you can
request the registration hold be lifted so that you can go ahead and
register for classes. To do so, send a polite email to the student office in
NPRE (specifically, the graduate student advisor staff member in NPRE),
CC'ing Prof. Huff, with a PDF copy of your student record document attached.
Let the staff member know that we have discussed the attached course
plan, Prof. Huff has approved it, and you would like to request the
registration hold be lifted.

Near the beginning of the semester, all students should update their Student
Record with the grades they have earned in the courses from the past
semester.

- [ ] Request your registration hold lifted
- [ ] Register for classes through Self Service

# How to Register

Registration is done through
[Self Service](https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/). First, click on the
link titled "*Registration & Records*". Most registration is through
"*Enhanced Registration*". From there, you can search and register for courses
and sections.

To register for Prof. Huff's Thesis Research, go instead to "*Classic
Registration*". Add the class "NPRE 599" and make sure to use the CRN number
24115 for Prof. Huff's section. The CRN numbers for all NPRE instructors can
be found [here](https://npre.illinois.edu/academics/courses/NPRE599-120198).
From there, you can change the amount of credits as necessary.
