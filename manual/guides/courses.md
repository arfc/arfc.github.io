# Undergraduates

Undergraduate students should be meeting with their faculty advisor once every semester. The students should be sure to bring a copy of the degree audit, or [DARS report](https://registrar.illinois.edu/academic-records/dars-audit/), and their plan for the coming semester. The NPRE department provides a [suggested course sequence](https://npre.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/curriculum) for students to use to help determine what classes they should be taking.

# Graduates

Graduate students should always make sure to review the course requirements for their degree. The link for the MS program can be found [here](http://catalog.illinois.edu/graduate/engineering/nuclear-plasma-radiological-engineering-ms/), and the link for the PhD program can be found [here](http://catalog.illinois.edu/graduate/engineering/nuclear-plasma-radiological-engineering-phd/).

Every graduate student will have a folder in Google Drive that is shared only between them and Prof. Huff. In that folder is a Student Plan, formatted as a spreadsheet. An example can be seen below.

Near the end of the semester and before registration opens, which is around the beginning of November or the middle of April, graduate students should fill out their plan for the upcoming semester and discuss it with Prof. Huff. Newer Research Assistantship students typically take 2 or 3 graduate classes per semester and take between 4 and 8 research credit hours. Later in graduate school, students typically take 1 or fewer graduate classes per semester and fill the rest of their required course load with research credits. Once  Prof. Huff has approved the course plan in your Student Record, you can request that the registration hold be lifted so that you can go ahead and register for classes. To do so, send a polite email to the student office in NPRE (specifically, the graduate student advisor staff member in NPRE), CC'ing Prof. Huff, with a PDF copy of your student record document attached. Let the staff member know that we have discussed the attached course plan, Prof. Huff has approved it, and you would please like the registration hold lifted.

Once the hold has been lifted, log onto [Self Service](https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/), then go to "Registration & Records" then "Enhanced Registration" to register for classes. After the semester has started, be sure to check your Student Record and keep it updated with the grades from the previous semester.
