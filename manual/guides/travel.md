# Traveling

Traveling for ARFC purposes should be done in these steps:


## 1. Plan Ahead!

You will need :

- **A duration.** For example, you may want to travel from April 9th to 13th.
- **A destination.** For example, you might be traveling to Charlotte, NC.
- **A purpose for travel.** Perhaps you want to attend the International High Level Radioactive Waste Conference. 
- **A justification for travel.** For example, you may want to present an 
  accepted paper. Prof. Huff is not likely to approve travel if the student has 
  no research to present. 
- **Release from campus duties.** If you are in classes, determine a plan for 
  making up homework and exams. If you are a TA, make sure you communicate with 
  your supervisor, the course instructor, regarding the absence.

## 2. Create a budget. 

You will need to estimate the cost of the trip. Consider:

- **Flights.** Find an example itinerary.
- **Hotel.** Check if there is a discount provided by the conference.
- **Registration Fee.** If this conference requires registration, how much?
- **Other items.** Cabs, bus rides, per diem...
- **Offsets.** Can you apply for a travel grant? Is there a student program to 
  reimburse costs?

## 3. Decide : Pre-Paid or reimbursed?

Once you have created a budget, decide whether you would like to make these 
purchases yourself (to be reimbursed later) or if you would prefer these 
purchases to be prepaid by the department. **note: If you want to pay and get 
reimbursed, it can take as much as 5 months to receive reimbursement.**

## 4. Get approval from Prof. Huff.
Email or set up a meeting. She will need all of the above information to give 
her approval.

## 5. Submit a Travel Request Form

- Go to [my.npre.illinois.edu](my.npre.illinois.edu) -> HR APPS -> Travel
- Click 'Create Request'
- List Prof. Huff (kdhuff) as your supervisor.
- Fill out the form.
- The account number must be provided by Prof. Huff **Note: It differs by 
  what grant you are under! Never use someone else's!**

## 6. Wait for approval by the supervisor

If it seems to be taking a while, check in with Prof. Huff. She, or someone 
else in the chain, may have missed the approval email.

## 7. Make purchases

Please see this completed quickly. It's best to get government rates for the 
hotel where the conference is at. Airbnb can be unreliable. 

- **If the department will make the purchases,** work closely with Prof. Huff 
  and the department staff to make these purchases. 
- **If you're going to make the purchases yourself** go right ahead, and keep 
  the receipts.

## 8. Go on the trip. Be safe!

Please note that even while on travel, students, staff, and faculty are 
representatives of the university and our ARFC research group.


### 9. Go to the NPRE main office to pick up the Travel Itinerary Reimbursement Form.
You have 60 days to complete  your Reimbursement Expense Report or it becomes taxable income.

### 10. Fill out the Form, be very very detailed, I recommend using a following format:
1. Write down the basic information (name, contact, account number etc)
2. Print out a separate sheet for the descriptions
and writing 'SEE ATTACHED' in the actual form [example](/img/manual/guides/tra-example.pdf)
3. Print out all the receipts from the travel (airfare, lodging are major ones)
4. The table is PER DAY, means that each row is a day
5. For the first and last day, you must state the day of departure and arrival of your mode of transportation
6. `Per Diem - Circle meals requested` is where you circle meals that were NOT PROVIDED BY THE CONFERENCE, and the ones you had to pay for. The reimbursements are set as $6.50 for breakfast and lunch, and $19 for dinner, total up to $32 per day.
7. Explain EVERYTHING at `Other details or further explanation`, and why it was of benefit to the University. 

### 11. Recommendations and Tips:

1. If you presented a paper (or a poster presentation), it is beneficial to attach a copy of your paper.
2. Always try to include Who, What, When, Where, Why.
3. Be EXTREMELY detailed (if you think 'do I really need this?' - just attach it and write it)

### 12. Get the form signed by your PI (sponsor of the trip)

### 13. Organize everything, put it in an envelope and give it to Barbara Russell

### 14. If you followed this guide, your submission will be pleasing to her eyes.

### 15. Later you will get an email from a staff member from EBSC who will fill out the actual online form for you,
add that person as a 'proxy' by logging into TEM -> My info -> Creator Proxy

### 16. Log in to the [Travel Expense Management (TEM) Services](https://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/tem-resources/) by clicking on the LOG IN button tomorrow. 

### 17. If you are not authorized to log in, you might have to contact Tessa M Hile (tmhile@illinois.edu) for authorization (She is our department USC)

### 18. Now the EBSC staff will complete your form for you, and let you know when it is ready for review and submission or if there is any error or if your submission needs revision. Please review the form
for accuracy and that all the expenses are listed (print mode makes it easier to see).
