# Traveling

Traveling for ARFC purposes should be done in these steps:


## 1. Plan Ahead!

You will need :

- **A duration.** For example, you may want to travel from April 9th to 13th.
- **A destination.** For example, you might be traveling to Charlotte, NC.
- **A purpose for travel.** Perhaps you want to attend the International High Level Radioactive Waste Conference. 
- **A justification for travel.** For example, you may want to present an 
  accepted paper. Prof. Huff is not likely to approve travel if the student has 
  no research to present. 
- **Release from campus duties.** If you are in classes, determine a plan for 
  making up homework and exams. If you are a TA, make sure you communicate with 
  your supervisor, the course instructor, regarding the absence.

## 2. Create a budget. 

You will need to estimate the cost of the trip. Consider:

- **Flights.** Find an example itinerary.
- **Hotel.** Check if there is a discount provided by the conference.
- **Registration Fee.** If this conference requires registration, how much?
- **Other items.** Cabs, bus rides, per diem...
- **Offsets.** Can you apply for a travel grant? Is there a student program to 
  reimburse costs?

## 3. Decide : Pre-Paid or reimbursed?

Once you have created a budget, decide whether you would like to make these 
purchases yourself (to be reimbursed later) or if you would prefer these 
purchases to be prepaid by the department. **note: If you want to pay and get 
reimbursed, it can take as much as 5 months to receive reimbursement.**

## 4. Get approval from Prof. Huff.

Email or set up a meeting. She will need all of the above information to give 
her approval.

## 5. Submit a Travel Request Form

- Go to [my.npre.illinois.edu](my.npre.illinois.edu) -> HR APPS -> Travel
- Click 'Create Request'
- List Prof. Huff (kdhuff) as your supervisor.
- Fill out the form.
- The account number must be provided by Prof. Huff **Note: It differs by 
  what grant you are under! Never use someone else's!**

## 6. Wait for approval by the supervisor

If it seems to be taking a while, check in with Prof. Huff. She, or someone 
else in the chain, may have missed the approval email.

## 7. Make purchases

Please see this completed quickly. It's best to get government rates for the 
hotel where the conference is at. Airbnb can be unreliable. 

- **If the department will make the purchases,** work closely with Prof. Huff 
  and the department staff to make these purchases. 
- **If you're going to make the purchases yourself** go right ahead, and keep 
  the receipts.

## 8. Go on the trip. Be safe!

Please note that even while on travel, students, staff, and faculty are 
representatives of the university and our ARFC research group.

## 9. Fill out the TEM form

After the trip, fill out the [Travel Expense Management (TEM) 
form](https://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/tem-resources/). Follow the [Expense 
Report 
Guide](https://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/common/pages/DisplayFile.aspx?itemId=94835). 

## 10. Submit recipts to Department

At this point, you will have receipts for items you purchased. You must submit 
them to the NPRE department office. There is a paper form, with a small manilla 
envelope which you must get from the department office and give to the 
administrative assistants there.
