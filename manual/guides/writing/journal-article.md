## Before Writing

- [ ] Assemble all of the figures and tables.
- [ ] Arrange them in such a way that they tell a story.
- [ ] Make sure that their captions are sufficient to understand the full 
  meaning of each. 
- [ ] Is there a gap in the story? Perhaps a figure or table is missing. Create 
  it.

## Rules of the Journal Article

A summary paragraph is often the last step, but [one should get it 
right](http://s3-service-broker-live-19ea8b98-4d41-4cb4-be4c-d68f4963b7dd.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/ckeditor/attachments/7808/2c_Summary_para.pdf).
Consider these [ten simple rules for structuring 
papers](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619).
Indeed, the MIT Communication Lab has a whole set of articles of their website 
[on how to write journal 
articles.](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/use-the-commkit/)
Don't forget the [checklist](/manual/guides/writing/checklist).

## After Writing

- [ ] Submit a pre-print to the ArXiv
- [ ] Create a Zotero item in group-pubs
