## What is a Report

A report, also known as a technical report, is typically issued by a research 
institution which evaluates and affirms the work. This evaluation is an 
internal process and accordingly, reports are not 'peer reviewed' literature.

Technical reports are usually produced to report on a specific research need. 
They can serve as a report of accountability to the organization funding the 
research. They provides access to the information before it is published 
elsewhere.
