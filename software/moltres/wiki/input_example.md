title: Example Input File
permalink: /software/moltres/wiki/input_example/
---

The input file example documented here is taken from
[`moltres/tests/twod_axi_coupled/auto_diff_rho.i`](https://github.com/arfc/moltres/blob/devel/tests/twod_axi_coupled/auto_diff_rho.i).
This is a simple 2-D axisymmetric core model of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)
that was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was operated from 1965
through 1969. Simulation results from this 2-D model are documented in the
article, [Introduction to Moltres: An application for simulation of Molten Salt
Reactors](http://arfc.github.io/papers/lindsay_introduction_2018.pdf).
which discusses simulation results, and compares them to a 3-D Motlres model of
the MSRE and to MSRE data and calculated results. It should be noted that
Figure 1 of the article indicates that the width of the model is 145 cm. This
however, is the diameter of the entire core. A careful reader would notice that
the width of the plots in the article is 1/2 this width, and the width indicated
in Figure 1 is not representative of the model.

Assuming that Moltres has been successfully compiled, to execute this input file
from the command line, run the following from a terminal window, substituting
`$moltres_root` with the path to the Moltres root directory:

```
cd $moltres_root/tests/twod_axi_coupled
../../moltres-opt -i auto_diff_rho.i
```

In serial, this job takes around 90 seconds on a 2.7 GHz machine. To run the job in
parallel, execute:

```
mpirun -np 2 ../../moltres-opt -i auto_diff_rho.i
```

where the number of processors can be changed from 2 to however many processes
you want to run. The parallel performance of the job depends on the number of
degrees of freedom in the problem and the preconditioner used. A general rule of
thumb for optimal scaling is not to go below 20k degrees of freedom per
processor, otherwise communication becomes a performance drag. Additionally many
preconditioners do not perform as well when spread over multiple processes as
they lose access to "new" information. (See
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/faq.html#slowerparallel for more
discussion of this). This particular input file (`auto_diff_rho.i`) only has
8,697 degrees of freedom so communication is a factor; however, the executioner
used is a direct solver which scales well. On the same 2.7 GHz machine, the
solution times for 1-4 processors are given below.

- Single processor solution time: 90 seconds
- Two processors: 50 seconds
- Three: 35 seconds
- Four: 30 seconds

Before delving into a description of the input file, we note that all the
parameter options for different input blocks can be seen by executing
`moltres-opt --dump`.

Example output corresponding to the input file under discussion can be found in
`$moltres_root/tests/twod_axi_coupled/gold/auto_diff_rho.e`. The most common
application for visualizing output files is
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/), although
[VisIt](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/) or
[yt](http://yt-project.org/) may also be used.

#### Model Geometry

The figure below shows the domain for the 2-D MSRE model. It is a
72.5 cm by 151.75 cm rectangle that is
slightly smaller than the total height of the core, and includes 1/2 the width
of the core, extending from the core center line on the left to the core wall on
the right. For this steady-state simulation, the core center line is a symmetry
boundary. The domain models 14 fuel channels and alternates between regions that
represent the molton salt fuel flow channels and the solid graphite moderator
regions respectively. In the figure below, the blue (cyan) rectangles represent
fuel / molton salt regions and the grey rectangles represent the graphite
moderator regions.

![1/2 Core Model](../figures/input_example_mesh.png)

#### File Format

Moltres is built on top of the MOOSE framework, and the input file uses the "hierarchal
input text format" (hit) input format adopted by MOOSE. A brief description of the
input syntax is presented [here](https://www.mooseframework.org/application_usage/input_syntax.html).
This is a relatively simple file format that uses `[names in brackets]` to mark the
start and end of input blocks. The format is loosely based on a directory structure
with nesting of blocks allowed and `[../]` being used to indicate the end of a
block (i.e., going up one level). Empty brackets `[]` can also be used to indicate
the end of a block. *Note that block names and parameter names are generally case
sensitive in the input file.* In addition, in Moltres/MOOSE input file, the `#`
symbol is used to mark the start of a comment. Comments may start anywhere on a line.

#### Substitution Variables

Root level variables can be used as substitution variables throughout the document
by using the syntax `${varname}`. Starting at the top of the input file, the
following substitution variables are defined:

```
flow_velocity=21.7      # cm/s. See MSRE-properties.ods
ini_temp=922
diri_temp=922
nt_scale=1e13
```

- `flow_velocity` is used to set the upward flow velocity of the fuel / molton
  salt in this model.
- `ini_temp` is used below to set the initial temperature in the fuel and moderator.
- `diri_temp` is used to control the inlet temperature boundary condition.
- `nt_scale` is a transient fission heat source term scaling factor.

These variables may be modified to affect our primary system variables:
temperature, neutron flux, and precursor concentrations. Decreasing the flow velocity
will increase the temperature through the reactor. Because of the negative
feedback coefficients of fuel and moderator for this reactor composition (modeled
after Oak Ridge's MSRE), the increase in average reactor temperature decreases the
total reactor power and consequently the neutron fluxes and precursor
concentrations. Similarly, increasing the inlet temperature via `diri_temp`
decreases reactor power.

#### `GlobalParams` Block<a name="GlobalParams"></a>

Following the substitution variable definitions, we have the `GlobalParams` block:

```
[GlobalParams]
  num_groups = 2
  num_precursor_groups = 6
  use_exp_form = false
  group_fluxes = 'group1 group2'
  temperature = temp
  sss2_input = false
  pre_concs = 'pre1 pre2 pre3 pre4 pre5 pre6'
  account_delayed = true
[]
```

In `GlobalParams`, parameters like `num_groups` can be globally set to a
value. Consequently any class (e.g. the kernel class `GroupDiffusion`) that has
the parameter `num_groups` will read in a value of `2` unless it is overridden
locally in its input block. It should be noted that the `GlobalParams`
block and any other MOOSE input block can be placed anywhere in the input file.
At execution time each block will be read when it is needed. Below is a description
of the parameters included in the GlobalParams section:

- `num_groups`: The number of energy groups for neutron diffusion
- `num_precursor_groups`: The number of delayed neutron precursor groups
- `use_exp_form`: Whether the actual neutron/precursor fluxes/concentrations
  should be represented by $$u$$ or $$e^u$$ where $$u$$ is the actual variable
  value
- `group_fluxes`: The names of the neutron group fluxes
- `temperature`: The name of the temperature variable. Some of the kernel or boundary
   condition variables require an input named `temperature` which specifies the
   variable used to represent temperature. The variable `temp` will be specified
   below in the `[Variables]` block.
- `sss2_input`: True if the macroscopic group constants were generated by
  Serpent 2. False otherwise
- `pre_concs`: The names of the precursor concentration variables
- `account_delayed`: Whether to account for delayed neutron production. Modifies
  the neutron source term

#### `Variables` Block

The `Variables` block is used to indicate the primary solution variables, or
equivalently, to indicate the number of partial differential equations (PDEs)
that will be defined in the [Kernels](#Kernels) and [BCs](#BCs) blocks. For this
model, the `group1` and `group2` neutron fluxes and the fuel and moderator
`temp` (temperature) are the system variables that are being solved for by the
PDEs. In the [Kernels](#Kernels) and [BCs](#BCs) blocks described below, each
kernel and BC term must be associated with one primary variable from the
`Variables` list below to indicate which PDE the term is included in.

  ```
  [Variables]
    [./group1]
      order = FIRST
      family = LAGRANGE
      initial_condition = 1
      scaling = 1e4
    [../]
    [./group2]
      order = FIRST
      family = LAGRANGE
      initial_condition = 1
      scaling = 1e4
    [../]
    [./temp]
      initial_condition = ${ini_temp}
      scaling = 1e-4
    [../]
  []
  ```

Sub-blocks are initialized with `[./<object_name>]` and closed with `[../]`. The
`[./group1]` sub-block creates a `MooseVariable` object with the name `group1`.
The parameters purpose of the parameter is as follows:

- `family` describes the shape function type used to form the
  approximate finite element solution.
- `order` denotes the polynomial order of the shape functions.
- `initial_condition` is an optional parameter that can be used to set a spatially
  uniform initial value for the variable.
- `scaling` is another optional parameter that can be used to scale the residual
  of the corresponding variable; this is usually done when different
  variables have residuals of different orders of magnitude.

#### `Mesh` Block<a name="Mesh"></a>

Next in our input file we have the `Mesh` block. The two most commonly used `Mesh`
types are `FileMesh` and `GeneratedMesh`. The `Mesh` input block by default assumes
type `FileMesh` and takes a parameter argument `file = <mesh_file_name>`.

```
[Mesh]
  file = '2-D_lattice_structured.msh'
[]
```

Many MOOSE users generate their meshes using
Cubit/Trelis. For national lab employees this software is free; however,
academic or industry users must pay. Consequently, Moltres meshes to date have
been generated using the software [gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) which is free and
open source. Binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux as well as source code can be
downloaded [here](http://gmsh.info/#Download). Ubuntu users may also install
`gmsh` using `sudo apt-get install gmsh`. We will not go into the details of
using `gmsh` but the interested user should peruse its
[documentation](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html). There are many example
`gmsh` input files in the Moltres repository (denoted by the `.geo`
extension). To generate a mesh for use with Moltres, a typical bash command is
`gmsh -2 -o file_name.msh file_name.geo` where `2` should be replaced with the
dimension of the mesh, the argument following `-o` is the name of the output
`.msh` file, and the last argument is the input `.geo` file.

Gmsh or Cubit can be used for generation of highly complex mesh
structures. However, if the user just wishes to generate a simple mesh, he/she
may use MOOSE's built-in type `GeneratedMesh`. For using `GeneratedMesh` we
refer the reader [here](http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/Mesh/).

#### `Problem` Block

Next in our example input file, we have the `Problem` block. The `Problem` block
may usually be omitted from the input file for a Cartesian simulation. However,
since this particular example is using 2D-axisymmetric coordinates, we have to
convey this information using `Problem`'s `coord_type` parameter.

```
[Problem]
  coord_type = RZ
[]
```

#### `Precursors` Block<a name="Precursors"></a>

Whereas all the other blocks that have been introduced are standard MOOSE
blocks, `Precursors` is a custom input file block unique to Moltres. The
`Precursors` action sets up the delayed neutron precursor concentration equations:

$$ \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} + \bar{u} \cdot \nabla C_i + \lambda_i C_i
   - \sum_{g'=1}^{G} \beta_i \nu \Sigma_{g'}^f \phi_{g'} = 0$$

The precursor variables, kernels, and boundary conditions necessary for solving
the precursor governing equations are all instantiated by the `Precursors` action.
Six precursor groups (symbolized by the index i in the equation above)
are modeled, as specified via the `num_precursor_groups` in the
[`GlobalParams`](#GlobalParams) block. $$G$$ is the number of neutron flux energy
groups, and $$g'$$ is the index associated with the energy groups. For this problem
two energy groups are modeled, with the equations configured explicitly in the
[Kernels](#Kernels) and [BCs](#BCs) blocks documented after this section.

```
[Precursors]
  [./pres]
    var_name_base = pre
    block = 'fuel'
    outlet_boundaries = 'fuel_tops'
    u_def = 0
    v_def = ${flow_velocity}
    w_def = 0
    nt_exp_form = false
    family = MONOMIAL
    order = CONSTANT
    # jac_test = true
  [../]
[]
```

Parameter descriptions:

- `var_name_base`: The prefix for the precursor variable names. Name suffixes are
  numbers, e.g. `pre1, pre2, ...`
- `block`: This is a parameter ubiquitous to many MOOSE classes such as kernels
  and materials. By specifying a value for `block` the user is asking that in
  this case, precursors and their associated governing equations only be
  solved for in the `fuel` mesh subdomains
- `outlet_boundaries`: The mesh boundaries from which the precursors flow out
- `u_def, v_def, w_def`: The x, y, and z components of velocity, or in the case
  of an RZ simulation, `u_def` is the r velocity component, `v_def` is the
  z-component, and `w_def` has no meaning
- `nt_exp_form`: Whether the neutron group fluxes have their concentrations in
  an exponential form. If `use_exp_form` is false in the `GlobalParams` block,
  this should also be false
- `jac_test`: true if testing the application developer's jacobian against a
  jacobian formed through finite differencing of the residuals. Defaults to
  false.

#### `Kernels` Block <a name="Kernels"></a>

The `Kernels` block is used to construct PDEs that are included in the system of
equations that are solved. Each PDE has a primary variable that is being solved for,
and the list of variables being solved for is defined in the [Variables](#Variables)
block shown above. There is an additional PDE solved as part of the system of
PDEs for each variable defined in the `Variables` section. In this case, three
solution variables were defined in the variable section:

* The `group1` fast group neutron flux.
* The `group2` thermal group neutron flux.
* The molton salt / moderator temperature (`temp`).

Note that additional precursor variables are automatically defined by the
[`Precursors`](#Precursors) block.

The `Kernels` section defines a set of "Kernels", where a "Kernel" represents a
single term included in a PDE. A PDE is constructed by specifying the set of terms
(or Kernels) that will be included in the PDE in the `Kernels` block, and by
specifying which PDE the kernel is associated with. This is done by indicating
which of the above three variables the kernel is associated with (i.e., `group1`,
`group2`, or `temp`).

Thus each entry in the `Kernels` block specifies a term to include in one of
PDEs that are solved. The `type = <kernel type>` parameter associated with a
kernel entry identifies the term (or Kernel) that will be included in the PDE,
and the `variable = <primary variable>` value indicates the primary solution
variable (from the [Variables](#Variables) block) associated with the term, or
equivalently which PDE the term will be included in. MOOSE provides several
standard kernels that can be included in a PDE. Moltres defines an additional set
of kernels that are useful in modeling neutron flux and associated phenomenon in
molton salt reactors. The mathematical form of the Moltres kernels can be found
on the [kernel wiki page](/software/moltres/wiki/kernels).

Kernels can be optionally restricted to specific subdomains within the model by setting
`block = <subdomain_names>`. Note that this implies that the form of the equation
that is solved may differ in different mesh regions. The equations that are modeled
are represented below, followed by the input required to construct these equations.
In the `group1` and `group2` neutron flux equations below and in the input that
follows, notice that the fission kernel (`CoupledFissionKernel`)
is only included in the fuel region, and is not included in the moderator region
(since there is no fuel in the moderator region). Also, the `DelayedNeutronSource`
kernel, which contributes neutrons from the precursor group equations, is only
included as part of the `group1` or fast group equation.

In the heat transfer equation, the advection kernel (`ConservativeTemperatureAdvection`)
is only included in the fuel region since advection is not relevant in the solid
graphite moderator region. The fission heat source term is also restricted to the
'Fuel' region, since fission only occurs in the fuel region and not in the moderator
region.

**Neutronics Equation for `group1` and `group2` Variables (g = 1 or 2)**

$$\underbrace{\frac{1}{v_g}\frac{\partial \phi_g}{\partial t}}_{NtTimeDerivative}
  + \underbrace{\Sigma_g^r \phi_g}_{SigmaR}
  - \underbrace{\nabla \cdot D_g \nabla \phi_g}_{GroupDiffusion}
  - \underbrace{\sum_{g \ne g'}^G \Sigma_{g'\rightarrow g}^s \phi_{g'}}_{InScatter}
  - \underbrace{\chi_g^p \sum_{g' = 1}^G (1 - \beta) \nu \Sigma_{f,g'} \phi_{g'}}_{CoupledFissionKernel\\ \textrm{'Fuel' region only}}
  - \underbrace{\chi_g^d \sum_i^I \lambda_i C_i}_{DelayedNeutronSource\\ \textrm{'Fuel' region only} \\ \textrm{Not in group2 Eqn}}
  = 0$$

**Heat Transfer Equation for `temp` Variable**

$$ \underbrace{\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}}_{[1]}
   + \underbrace{\rho c_p \bar{u} \cdot \nabla T}_{[2]~\textrm{'Fuel' region only}}
   - \underbrace{k \nabla^2 T}_{MatDiffusion \\ \textrm{(Conduction)}}
   - \underbrace{\sum_{g=1}^G \epsilon_{f,g}\Sigma_{f,g}\phi_g}_{TransientFissionHeatSource \\ \textrm{'Fuel' region only}}
   = 0 $$

- [1] = MatINSTemperatureTimeDerivative
- [2] = ConservativeTemperatureAdvection
- $$\bar{u}$$ = fuel / molton salt velocity

#### `BCs` Block <a name="BCs"></a>

The `BCs` block is very similar to the `Kernels` block except the
`boundary = <boundary_names>` parameter must be specified to indicate where the boundary
conditions should be applied. The mathematical form of the BCs can be found on
the [BCs wiki page](/software/moltres/wiki/bcs).

```

    variable = temp
    velocity = '0 ${flow_velocity} 0'
  [../]
[]
```

#### `Functions` Block

The `Functions` block is necessary when other MOOSE/Moltres objects specified in
the input file require functions. In this example we have a boundary condition
object `temp_diri_cg` of type `FunctionDirichletBC` that requires a function
object to specify the values of the variable `temp` along the reactor
boundaries. We name this function object `temp_bc_func` and specify it to be of
type `ParsedFunction` which is a function type that can be written in terms of
constants and the independent variables $$x, y, z$$ and $$t$$. Here we see the
use of substitution variable syntax `${<variable_name>}$` to access the values
of `ini_temp` and `diri_temp` specified at the top of the input file.

```
[Functions]
  [./temp_bc_func]
    type = ParsedFunction
    value = '${ini_temp} - (${ini_temp} - ${diri_temp}) * tanh(t/1e-2)'
  [../]
[]
```

#### `Materials` Block

In the `Materials` block we specify materials that live on a mesh
subdomain. Any given subdomain can have as many materials as desired. An
important material in Moltres is `GenericMoltresMaterial`.

```
[Materials]
  [./fuel]
    type = GenericMoltresMaterial
    property_tables_root = '../property_file_dir/newt_msre_fuel_'
    interp_type = 'spline'
    block = 'fuel'
    prop_names = 'k cp'
    prop_values = '.0553 1967' # Robertson MSRE technical report @ 922 K
  [../]
  [./rho_fuel]
    type = DerivativeParsedMaterial
    f_name = rho
    function = '2.146e-3 * exp(-1.8 * 1.18e-4 * (temp - 922))'
    args = 'temp'
    derivative_order = 1
    block = 'fuel'
  [../]
  [./moder]
    type = GenericMoltresMaterial
    property_tables_root = '../property_file_dir/newt_msre_mod_'
    interp_type = 'spline'
    prop_names = 'k cp'
    prop_values = '.312 1760' # Cammi 2011 at 908 K
    block = 'moder'
  [../]
  [./rho_moder]
    type = DerivativeParsedMaterial
    f_name = rho
    function = '1.86e-3 * exp(-1.8 * 1.0e-5 * (temp - 922))'
    args = 'temp'
    derivative_order = 1
    block = 'moder'
  [../]
[]
```

Materials within the `Materials` block support the following parameters:

- `property_tables_root`: The path and prefix of the files that contain the
  macroscopic group constants that define neutron reaction rates. The suffix of
  these files identifies the property that each conveys. For example the file
  containing the fuel fission cross sections is in this example
  `newt_msre_fuel_FISSXS.txt`. Each of these files contains an interpolation
  table. The left column (column 1) is temperature. The remaining columns
  contain the macroscopic constants for different energy groups corresponding to
  the tabulated temperature, e.g. column 2 contains the constants for energy
  group 1, column 3 contains the constants for energy group 2, etc. The set of
  tables used in this example were generated with NEWT, part of the SCALE code
  system. Serpent, OpenMC, or any other macroscopic cross section generator may
  be used to create these simple input tables.
- `interp_type`: The type of fitting/interpolation to be carried out on the
  temperature grid. Options are:
    - `bicubic_spline`: Done when macroscopic constants are a function of the
      temperature of the local material as well as the average temperature of
      the other material
	- `spline`: Most common option used for monovariate interpolation between
      temperature knots
	- `least_squares`: Constructs a linear fit function of macroscopic constants
      as a function of temperature. Useful when group constant interpolation
      table is not monotonic
	- `none`: Only should be used when single values for constants are supplied
      at a single temperature
- `prop_names, prop_values`: name-value pairs used to define material property
  values from the input file. In this example, both the thermal conductivity
  $$k$$ and the specific heat capacity $$c_p$$ are defined from the input file
  for both fuel and moderator subdomains.

`DerivativeParsedMaterial` is a material inherited from the Phase Field module
of the MOOSE framework. Its useful for creating material properties that are
functions of solution variables and for coupling the dependency of the property
on the variable back into the Jacobian used for Newton-Raphson. A more in-depth
description of the material along with its relatives is given
[here](http://mooseframework.org/wiki/PhysicsModules/PhaseField/DevelopingModels/FunctionMaterials/).

Users can exert their greatest influence on the calculations through the
`Materials` block. Increasing values of `rho` or `cp` will increase materials
ability to store heat, enabling a greater reactor power. Because of application
of an insulating boundary condition at the outer reactor wall in this example,
modifying the thermal conductivity `k` has only a small impact on the
simulation. However, if the conductivity is lowered by several orders of
magnitude, the user will observe increases in radial gradients between the fuel
channels and graphite as well as a decrease in reactor power. Use of different
macroscopic group constant tables or direct modification of the current set
would also influence simulation results.

#### `Executioner` and `Preconditioning` Blocks

The `Executioner` and `Preconditioning` blocks are essential to determining the
method used to solve the system of non-linear equations created by finite
element discretization of our molten salt reactor governing
equations. `Executioner` and `Preconditioning` documentation can be found
[here](http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/Executioners/) and
[here](http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/Preconditioners/)
respectively.

#### `Postprocessors` Block

General postprocessor documentation can be found
[here](http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/Postprocessors/). In this
example, the first three postprocessors `group1_current, group1_old` and
`multiplication` are used to calculate the neutron multiplication between
current and old timesteps. The `IntegralNewVariablePostprocessor` integrates the
supplied variable's value over the entire domain at the current time step. The
`IntegralOldVariablePostprocessor` does the same thing but for the previous
time-step. The `DivisionPostprocessor` then divides `value1` by `value2`. The
`ElementAverageValue` postprocessor simply calculates the average value of a
variable over an optionally restricted domain. `AverageFissionHeat`, commented
out in this example, determines the average volumetric fission heating rate over
a domain. This has been used to implement gamma radiation heating in the
moderator as some fraction of the average fission heat produced in the fuel.

```

```

#### `Outputs` Block

`Outputs` documentation is
[here](http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/Outputs/).

```
[Outputs]
  print_perf_log = true
  print_linear_residuals = true
  [./exodus]
    type = Exodus
    file_base = 'auto_diff_rho'
    execute_on = 'final'
  [../]
[]
```

#### `Debug` Block

This simply tells our executable to print the variable residual norms during the
non-linear solve.

```
[Debug]
  show_var_residual_norms = true
[]
```

#### `ICs` Block

The `ICs` block can be used to construct variable initial
conditions. Documentation is
[here](http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/ICs/). The commented out
`ICs` in this particular file are sometimes used to test the Jacobians of new
kernels and boundary conditions introduced into Moltres.

```
# [ICs]
#   [./temp_ic]
#     type = RandomIC
#     variable = temp
#     min = 922
#     max = 1022
#   [../]
#   [./group1_ic]

#     variable = group1
#     min = .5
#     max = 1.5
