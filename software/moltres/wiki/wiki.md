When learning Moltres and the underlying MOOSE framework, it may be best to
start with a
[tutorial](https://www.mooseframework.org/workshop/#/)
and [examples](http://mooseframework.org/examples/index.html).

The following pages give the math behind the `Kernel` and `BC` classes that are
used to construct the weak forms of the PDEs required for the finite element
method:

- [Kernels](./kernels/)
- [BCs](./bcs/)

The page below gives a detailed outline of a typical Moltres input file and
should help the user prepare his/her own customized input:

- [Example Input](./input_example/)

The following page provides a general guide for `Executioner` and
`Preconditioning` settings:

- [Recommended Executioner and Preconditioner Settings](./recommended/)
