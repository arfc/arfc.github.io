The following pages give the math behind the `Kernel` and `BC` classes that are
used to construct the weak forms of the PDEs required for the finite element
method:

- [Kernels](./kernels/)
- [BCs](./bcs/)

The page below gives a detailed outline of a typical Moltres input file and
should help the user prepare his/her own customized input:
